1 .1 THE CATEGORIES OF TAWHEED

```
iterally tawheed means “unification” (making something one) or “asserting
```
###### oneness,” and it comes from the Arabic verb ـدحو ( wahhada ) which itself

means to unite, unify, or consolidate.^1 However, when the term _tawheed_ is
used in reference to Allaah (i.e. _tawheedullaah_ )^2 , it means realizing and affirming
Allaah’s unity in all of man’s actions which directly or indirectly relate to Him. It
is the belief that Allaah’s One, without partner in His dominion ( _ruboobeeyah_ ),
One without similitude in His essence and attributes ( _asmaa was sifaat_ ), and One
without rival in His divinity and in worship ( _ulooheeyah ‘ibaadah_ ). These three
aspects form the basis for the categories into which the science of _tawheed_ has
been traditionally divided. The three overlap and are inseparable to such a degree
that whoever omits any one aspect has failed to complete the requirements of
_tawheed_. The omission of any of the above mentioned aspects of _tawheed_ is
referred to as _shirk_ (which literally means “sharing” but here signifies) the
association of partners with Allaah. In Islamic terms this association is in fact

###### idolatry.

Because of this principle of _tawheed_ , the Islamic belief in God is uniquely
unitarian and Islaam is counted among the world’s monotheistic religions along
with Judaism and Christianity. However, according to the Islamic unitarian
concept ( _tawheed_ ), Christianity is classified as polytheism and Judaism is
considered to be a subtle form of idolatry.

Thus, the principle of _tawheed_ is very profound and needs further
clarification even among Muslims. This point is vividly illustrated by the fact that
some Muslims like Ibn ‘Arabee^3 understood _tawheed_ to mean monism; that

Inc., New York, 3 rd. ed., 19 76), p. 1055.
(^2) The word _tawheed_ does not actually occur in either the Qur’aan or in the statements ( _Hadeeths_ )
of the Prophet (r). However, when the Prophet (r) sent Mu‘aadh ibn Jabal as governor of Yemen
in 9 AH, he told him, “You will be going to Christians and Jews ( _ahl al-Kitaab_ ), so the first thing
you should invite them to is the assertation of the oneness of Allaah ( _Yuwahhidoo Allaah_ ).”
(Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbaas and collected by al-Bukhaaree (Muhammad Muhsin Khan, _Sahih Al-
Bukhari,_ (Arabic-English), (Riyadh: Maktabah ar-Riyaad al-Hadeetha, 1981 ), vol. 9 , pp. 34 8-9,
no. 469 ) and Muslim (Abdul Hamid Siddiq, _Sahih Muslim_ (English Trans.), (Lahore: Sh.
Muhammad Ashraf Publishers, 1987 ), vol. 1 , pp.14- 5 , no. 2 7). In this _Hadeeth_ the present tense of
the verb from which the verbal noun _Tawheed_ is derived was used by the Prophet (r).
(^3) Muhammad ibn ‘Alee ibn ‘Arabee was born in Spain in the year 1165 CE and died in Damascus
in the year 1240 CE. He claimed to possess inner light and knowledge of Allaah’s greatest name
and referred to himself as the seal of the sainthood which he implied was a status higher than

## L


everything which exists is Allaah and Allaah is everything. He asserted that there
is only one real existence, which is Allaah everything else is unreal.^4 Yet, such
beliefs are classified by mainstream Islaam as pantheism and, as such, _kufr._ Other
Muslims such as the _Mu‘tazilah_^5 held that _tawheed_ consisted of stripping Allaah
of all His attributes and asserting that He is present everywhere and in everything;
yet these ideas were also rejected by orthodox Islaam and considered heretical. In
fact, almost all of the various heretical sects which broke off from the main body
of Islaam, from the Prophet’s time till today, began their divergence from the
point of _tawheed._ All of those who worked for the destruction of Islaam and the
misguidance of its followers have attempted to neutralize the principle of
_tawheed,_ because it represents the very essence of the divine message of Islaam
brought by all the prophets. They have introduced concepts about Allaah totally
alien to Islaam; concepts designed to take man away from the worship of Allaah
alone. Once people accept these pagan philosophies about God, they become
easily susceptible to a multitude of other deviant ideas, all of which eventually
lead those who accept them to the worship of created things under the guise of the
true worship of God.

The Prophet (r) himself vividly warned Muslims to beware of such
deviations as had befallen the nations before them. He encouraged them to stick
closely to the path which he had tread. One day as he sat with his companions, he
drew a straight line in the dirt. He then drew a series of lines branching off from
either side of it. When the companions asked him what it meant, he pointed to the
branches and told them that they represented the various paths of misguidance in
this life. He went on to say that at the head of each path sat a devil inviting people
to it. After that, he pointed to the straight line in the middle and told them that it
represented the path of Allaah. When the companions asked for further
clarification, he told them that it was his path and he recited the following verse:

prophethood. In the centuries following his death, his followers elevated him to the status of saint,
and gave him the title of _ash-Shaykh al-Akbar_ (The Greatest Master), but the majority of Muslim
legal scholars considered him a heretic. His principle works are _al-Futoohaat al-Makkeeyah_ and
_Fusoos al-Hikim,_ (H.A.R. Gibb and J.H. Kramers, _Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam,_ (Ithaca, New
York: Cornell University Press, 1953), pp.146-7. 4
A modern proponent of this belief called _wahdatul-wujood_ is Haroon Yahya. He has included a
chapter in most of his works written in refutation of Darwinism promoting this belief.

(^5) A rationalist philosophical school founded in the Umayyad period (i.e. early 8th century CE) by
Waasil ibn ‘Ataa and ‘Amr ibn ‘Ubayd. It gained sway over the ‘Abbaasid state for over a hundred
years and continued to influence Islamic thought until the 12th century ( _Shorter Encyclopedia of
Islam,_ pp.421-6).

“This is my path leading straight, so follow it. And do not follow the
other paths, or else you will be separated from His (Allaah’s) path.”^6
```
It is therefore of the utmost importance that _tawheed_ be clearly understood in the
way it was taught by the Prophet (r) and understood by his companions, or else
one could easily end up on one of the many deviant paths while claiming
_tawheed,_ praying, paying _zakaah,_^7 fasting and making Hajj. Allaah, Most Wise,
has pointed to this phenomenon when He said in the Qur’aan,

###### مشرِكﹸونﹶ وهم إِلَّ ا بِاللَّ هِ أﹶكﹾثﹶرهم يؤمِن وما

```
“Most of them claim to believe in Allaah, but they really commit
shirk.”^8
```
The three categories of _tawheed_ are commonly referred to by the
following titles:

1. Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah: lit. “Maintaining the oneness of Lordship,” that is,
affirming that Allaah is one, without partners in his sovereignty.
2. Tawheed al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat: lit. “Maintaining the unity of Allaah’s Names
and Attributes,” that is, affirming that they are incomparable and unique.
3. Tawheed al-‘Ibaadah: Affirming that Allaah is alone in his right to be
worshipped.^9

The division of _tawheed_ into its components was not done by the Prophet
(r) nor by his companions, as there was no necessity to analyze such a basic
principle of faith in this fashion. However, the foundations of the components are
all implied in the verses of the Qur’aan and in the explanatory statements of the
Prophet (r) and his companions, as will become evident when each category is
dealt with in more detail later.

(^9) Ibn Abil-‘Ezz al-Hanafee, _Sharh al-‘Aqeedah at-Tahaaweeyah,_ p.78.


The necessity for this analytical approach to the principle of _tawheed_ arose
after Islaam spread into Egypt, Byzantium, Persia and India and absorbed the
cultures of these regions. It is only natural to expect that when the peoples of
these lands entered the fold of Islaam, they would carry with them some of the
remnants of their former beliefs. When some of these new converts began to
express, in writings and discussion, their various philosophical concepts of God,
confusion arose in which the pure and simple unitarian belief of Islaam became
threatened. There were also others who had outwardly accepted Islaam but
secretly worked to destroy the religion from within, due to their inability to
oppose it militarily. This group began to actively propagate distorted ideas about
Allaah among the masses in order to tear down the first pillar of _eemaan_ (faith)
and with it Islaam istself.

The early caliphs and their governors were closer to Islamic principles,
and the consciousness of the masses was high due to the presence of the Prophet’s
companions and their students. Hence, the demand for the elimination of open
heretics received immediate response from the rulers. In contrast, the later
Umayyad caliphs were more corrupt and as such cared little about such religious
issues. The masses were also less Islamically conscious and thus were more
susceptible to deviant ideas. As greater numbers of people entered Islaam under
the Umayyads, and the learning of an increasing number of conquered nations
was absorbed, the execution of apostates was no longer used to stem the rising
tide of heresy. The task of opposing it fell on the shoulders of the Muslim scholars
of the period who rose to meet the challenge intellectually. They systematically
opposed the various alien philosophies and creeds by categorizing them and
countering them with principles deduced from the Qur’aan and the Sunnah. It was
out of this defense that the science of _tawheed_ emerged, with its precisely defined
categories and components. Therefore, as the categories of _tawheed_ are studied
separately and in more depth, it must not be forgotten that they are each a part of
an organic whole which is itself the foundation of a greater whole, Islaam itself.

**Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah (Maintaining the Unity of Lordship)**

This category is based on the fundamental concept that Allaah alone
caused all things to exist when there was nothing; He sustains and maintains
creation without any need from it or for it; and He is the sole Lord of the universe
and its inhabitants without any real challenge to His sovereignty. In Arabic the
word used to describe this creator-sustainer quality is _ruboobeeyah_ which is
derived from the root _Rabb_ (Lord). According to this category, since God is the
only real power in existence, it is He who gave all things the power to move and
to change. Nothing happens in creation except what He allows to happen. In


recognition of this reality, Prophet Muhammad (r) used to often repeat the
exclamatory phrase _“La hawla wa laa quwwata illaa billaah.”_ (There is no
movement nor power except by Allaah’s will).

The basis for the _ruboobeeyah_ concept can be found in many Qur’anic
verses. For example, Allaah says:

###### وكِيلﹲ شيءٍ كﹸلِّ علﹶى وهو شيءٍ كﹸلِّ خالِق هاللَّ

```
“Allaah created all things and He is the agent on which all things
depend.”^10
```
###### اللَّ هِ بِإِذﹾنِ إِلَّ ا مصِيبةٍ مِن أﹶصاب ما

```
“And no calamity strikes except by Allaah’s permission.”^11
```
The Prophet (r) further elaborated on this concept saying, _“Be aware that
if the whole of mankind gathered together in order to do something to help, they
would only be able to do something for you which Allaah had already written for
you. Likewise, if the whole of mankind gathered together to harm you, they would
only be able to do something to harm you which Allaah and already written would
happen to you.”_^12

Thus, what man conceives as good fortune and misfortune are merely
events predestined by Allaah as part of the tests of this life. The incidents follow
patterns set by Allaah alone. Allaah has said in the Qur’aan:

###### فﹶاحذﹶروهم لﹶكﹸم عدوا وأﹶولﹶادِكﹸم أﹶزواجِكﹸم مِن إِنَّ آمنوا الَّ ذِين ياأﹶيها

```
“O Believers! Surely there is in your wives and children an enemy
for you, so beware of them.”^13
```
That is, within the good things of this life there are severe tests of one’s faith in
God. Likewise, in the terrible events of life there lies test as is mentioned in the

Sometimes the patterns are recognizable, as in the case of cause and effect
relationship, and sometimes they are not, as in the case when apparently good
results come from evil means, or bad results from good means. God has explained
that the wisdom behind these apparent irregularities is often beyond man’s
immediate comprehension due to his limited scope of knowledge:

```
“It is possible that you dislike something that is really good for you,
or like something bad for you, but Allaah knows (what is best for
you), and you do not.”^15
```
Apparently evil events in human lives sometimes turn out to be for the best, and
apparently good things which people desire turn out to be harmful. Consequently,
man’s realm of influence in the course of events which make up his life is limited
to mental choices between options presented to him. The ultimate results of these
choices, however are not under his control. In other words, “Man proposes and
God disposes.” Apparent “good fortune” and “misfortune” are both from Allaah
and cannot be caused by good-luck charms such as rabbits’ feet, four-leaf clovers,
wishbones, lucky numbers, zodiacal signs, etc., or by omens of bad luck like
Friday the thirteenth, breaking mirrors, black cats, etc. In fact, the belief in charms
and omens is a manifestation of the grave sin of _shirk_ (association) in this form of
_tawheed._ ‘Uqbah, one of the companions of the Prophet (r), reported _that once a
group of men approached Allaah’s Messenger to give their allegiance to him, and
he accepted the oath from nine of them but refused to accept it from one. When
they asked him why he refused their companion’s oath, he replied, “Verily, he is
wearing an amulet.”_^16 _The man who was wearing the amulet put his hand in his_

(^15) Soorah al-Baqarah, (2):216.
(^16) A charm worn to bring good fortune or avert evil.


_cloak, pulled the amulet off, broke it, and then made the oath. The Prophet (r)
then said, “Whoever wears an amulet has committed shirk.”_^17

As for using the Qur’aan like a charm or amulet by wearing or carrying
Qur’anic verses on chains or in pouches to ward off evil or to bring good fortune,
there is little difference between such practices and those of the pagans. Neither
the Prophet (r) nor his companions used the Qur’aan in this fashion, and the
Prophet (r) said, _“Whoever innovates in Islaam something which does not belong
to it will have it rejected.”_^18 It is true that the Qur’anic chapters an-Naas and al-
Falaq, were revealed specifically for exorcism (that is, for removing evil spells),
but the Prophet (r) demonstrated the proper method by which they should be
used. On an occasion when a spell had been cast on him, he told ‘Alee ibn Abee
Taalib to recite the two chapters verse by verse, and when he became ill he used
to recite them on himself.^19 He did not write them down and hang them around his
neck, tie them on his arm or around his waist, nor did he tell others to do so.

**Tawheed al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat (Maintaining the Unity of Allaah’s
Names and Attributes)**

This category of _tawheed_ has five main aspects:

1. For the unity of Allaah’s names and attributes to be maintained in the first
aspect, Allaah must be referred to according to how He and His Prophet (r) have
described Him, without explaining away His names and attributes by giving them
meanings other than their obvious meaning. For example, in the Qur’aan Allaah
says that He gets angry with the disbelievers and the hypocrites. He says:

**الـسوءِ ظﹶن بِاللَّ هِ الظَّ انين والﹾمشرِكﹶاتِ والﹾمشرِكِين والﹾمنافِقﹶاتِ نافِقِين الﹾم ويعذِّ ب**

```
“...that He may punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the
pagans, men and women, who have an evil opinion of Allaah. A
circle of evil is around them; Allaah is angry with them, curses them
and has prepared for them an evil end.”^20
```
Thus, anger is one of God’s attributes. It is incorrect to say as some have, that His
“anger” must really mean His “punishment”, since anger is a sign of weakness in
man that does not befit Allaah. What Allaah has stated should be accepted, with
the qualification that His anger is not like human anger-based on Allaah’s

###### statement.

###### البصِير عالسمِي وهو ٌشيء كﹶمِثﹾلِهِ لﹶيس

###### “There is nothing like him.”^21

This verse clearly underscores the fact that Allaah’s attributes are different from
those of men. When this fact is overlooked, however, a strictly literal
interpretation of the verse will results in the denial of God’s very existence. For
Allaah describes Himself as living and man lives; therefore, according to this
“rationalist” argument, God neither lives nor exists.

In fact, the similarity between God’s attributes and those of mankind is in
name only and not in degree. When attributes are used in reference to God, they
are to be taken in the absolute sense, free from human deficiencies.

2. The second aspect of _Tawheed al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat_ involves referring
to Allaah as He has referred to Himself without giving Him any new names or
attributes. For example, Allaah may not be given the name _al-Ghaadib_ (the angry
one), in spite of the fact that He has said that He gets angry, because neither
Allaah nor His messenger has used this name. This may seem to be a very fine
point, but it must be maintained in order to prevent the false description of God.

###### That is, finite man is in no position to define the infinite Lord of creation.

The names _an-Naasir_ and _ar-Rasheed_ are among the common names
which cannot be authentically attributed to Allaah. Although their meanings are
true and are mentioned as attributes of Allaah, they cannot be found in any
Qur’aanic text or authentic _hadeeth._ They do, however, exist in a few _hadeeths_
containing a list of the 99 names of Allaah, some of which can be found printed in
copies of the Qur’aan. Unfortunately, all of these _hadeeths_ are inauthentic.

3. In the third aspect of _Tawheed al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat_ Allaah is referred
to without giving Him the attributes of His creation. For example, it is claimed in

(^20) Soorah al-Fath, (48):6.
(^21) Soorah ash-Shooraa, (42):11.


the Bible and Torah that Allaah spent the first six days creating the universe then
slept on the seventh.^22 For this reason, Jews and Christians take either Saturday or
Sunday as a day of rest during which work is looked at as a sin. Such a claim
assigns to God the attributes of His creation. It is man who tires after heavy work
and needs sleep to recuperate.^23 Elsewhere in the Bible and Torah, God is
portrayed as repenting for His bad thoughts in the same way that humans do when
they realize their errors.^24 Similarly the claim that God is a spirit or has a spirit
completely corrupts this are of _tawheed._ Allaah does not refer to Himself as a
spirit anywhere in the Qur’aan nor does His Prophet (r) express anything of the
nature in _hadeeth._ In fact, Allaah refers to the spirit as part of His creation.^25

The key principle which should be followed when dealing with Allaah’s
attributes is the Qur’anic formula,

###### البصِير عيالسمِ وهو ٌشيء كﹶمِثﹾلِهِ لﹶيس

```
“There is nothing at all like Him, and He is hearer and seer of all.”^26
```
The attributes of hearing and seeing are among human attributes, but when they
are attributed to The Divine Being they are without comparison in their
perfection. However, when these attributes are associated with men they
necessitate ear and eye apparatuses which cannot be attributed to God. What man
knows about the Creator is only what little He has revealed to him through His
prophets. Therefore, man is obliged to stay within these narrow limits. When man
gives free reign to his intellect in describing God, he is liable to fall into errors by
assigning to Allaah the attributes of His creation.

In their love of pictorial representations, Christians have painted, carved
and molded innumerable human likenesses and called them images of God. These
have served to pave the way for the acceptance of Jesus’ divinity among the
masses. Once they accepted the conception of the Creator as being like a human
being, accepting Jesus as God presented no real problem.

(^22) Genesis 2:2, “And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested
on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.” ( _Holy Bible,_ Revised Standard Version
(Nelson, 1951), p.2.
(^23) In contrast Allaah says explicity in the Qur’aan, **“No tiredness overcomes Him nor sleep...”**
(Soorah al-Baqarah, (2):255).
(^24) Expodus 32:14, “And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.” ( _Holy
Bible,_ Revised Standard Version).
(^25) Allaah clearly states that in the following verse: **“They ask you (Muhammad) about the
spirit. Tell (them) that the spirit (exists) by my Lord’s command”** (Soorah al-Israa, (17):85.
(^26) Soorah ash-Shoora, (42):11.


4. The fourth aspect of _tawheed as-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat_ requires that man
not be given the attributes of Allaah. For example, in the New Testament Paul
takes the figure of Melchizedek, king of Salem, from the Torah (Genesis 14:18-
20) and gives both him and Jesus the divine attribute of having no beginning or
end:
    1. For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, met
    Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, and
    to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by
    translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of
    Salem, that is, king of peace. **He is without father or mother or**
    **genealogy, and has neither beginning of days nor end of life, but**
    **resembling the son of God he continues a priest forever.**^27
    ‘5. So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was
    appointed by him who said to him, “Thou art my son, today I have
    begotten thee”; as he says also in another place, “Thou art a priest for
    ever, after the order of Melchizedek.”^28

Most _Shi‘ite_ sects (with the exception of the _Zaidites_ of Yemen) have given their
_“imams”_ divine attributes of absolute infallibility,^29 knowledge of the past, the
future and the unseen, the ability to change destiny^30 and control over the atoms
of creation.^31 In so doing they set up rivals who share God’s unique attributes and
who, in fact, become gods besides Allaah.

5. Maintaining the unity of Allaah’s names also means that Allaah’s
names in the definite form cannot be given to His creation unless preceded by the
prefix _‘Abd_ meaning “slave of” or “servant of.” Many of the Divine names in

(^27) Hebrews 7:1-3, ( _Holy Bible,_ Revised Standard Version).
(^28) Hebrews, 5:5-6 ( _Holy Bible,_ Revised Standard Version).
(^29) Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar states in his book _Faith of Shi‘a Islam,_ (U.S.A.: Muhammadi
Trust of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 2nd ed. 1983): “We believe that, like the prophet, an
**Imam must be infallible, that is to say incapable of making errors or doing wrong, either
inwardly or outwardly, from his birth to his death, either intentionally or unintentionally,**
because the Imams are the preservers of Islam and it is under their protection.” (p.32). See also
_Islam,_ (Teheran: A Group of Muslim Brothers, 1973), p.35, by Sayed Saeed Akhtar Rizvi.
(^30) Al-Muzaffar further states: “We maintain that the powers of the Imams to receive inspiration
has reached the highest degree of excellence, and we say that it is a Divinely-given power. By this
means **the Imam is able to understand information about anything, anywhere, and at any
time,** and he understands by means of this Divinely - given power at once, without recourse to
methodological reasoning or guidance from a teacher.
(^31) Al-Khomeini states: “Certainly the Imam has a dignified station, a lofty rank, a creational
caliphate, and sovereignty and mastery over all atoms of creation.” (Aayatullaah Musavi al-
Khomeini, _al-Hukoomah al-Islaameeyah,_ (Beirut: at-Talee‘ah Press, Arabic ed., 1979), p.52).


their indefinite form like _Ra’oof_ and _Raheem_ are allowable names for me because
Allaah has used some of them in their indefinite forms to refer to the Prophet (r):

But _ar-Ra’oof_ (the One Most Full of Pity) and _ar-Raheem_ (the Most Merciful)
can only be used to refer to men if they are preceded by ‘ _Abd_ as in _‘Abdur-Ra’oof_
or _‘Abdur-Raheem,_ since in the definite form they represent a level of perfection
which only belongs to God. The ‘Abbaside Caliph, Haroon _ar-Rasheed_ , used the
title “ _ar-Rasheed_ ” which would have been rejected by the scholars of his time,
had it been actually one of Allaah’s names. On the other hand, names like _‘Abdur-
Rasool_ (slave of the messenger), _‘Abdun-Nabee_ (slave of the Prophet), _‘Abdul-
Husayn_ (slave of Husayn), etc., where people name themselves slave to other than
Allaah are also forbidden. Based on this principle, the Prophet (r) forbade
Muslims from referring to those put under their charge as ‘ _abdee_ (my slave) or
_amatee_ (my slave girl).^33

**Tawheed al-‘Ebaadah (Maintaining The Unity of Worship)**

In spite of the wide implications of the first two categories of _tawheed,_ firm belief
in them alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Islamic requirements of _tawheed.
Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah_ and _Tawheed al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat_ must be
accompanied by their complement, _Tawheed al-’Ibaadah,_ in order for _tawheed_ to
be considered complete according to Islaam. This point is substantiated by the
fact that Allaah Himself has related in clear terms that the _mushrikoon_ (idolators)
of the Prophet’s time confirmed many aspects of the first two forms of _tawheed._
In the Qur’aan Allaah tells the Prophet (r) to say to the pagans:

The pagan Makkans all knew that Allaah was their creator, sustainer, their Lord
and Master; yet that knowledge did not make them Muslims according to God. In
fact, Allaah said:

Mujaahid’s^37 commentary on this verse was as follows: “Their belief in Allaah,
represented by their statement, ‘Allaah created us, provides for us and takes our
lives, did not stop them from worshipping other gods along with Allaah.”^38 From
the previously mentioned verses, it is clear that the _kuffaar_ (disbelievers) knew of
Allaah’s sovereignty, dominion and power. In fact, they used to faithfully devote
various types of worship to Him like Hajj, charity, animal sacrifices, vows and
even prayers in times of dire necessity and calamity. They even used to claim that
they were following the religion of Abraham. Because of that claim, Allaah
revealed the verse:

Taahir and published in two volumes under the title, _Tafseer Mujaahid,_ (Islamabad: Majma‘ al-
Buhooth).

“Abraham was not a Jew, nor was he a Christian, but (he) was a true
Muslim and not among those who joined partners with Allaah.”^39
```
Some pagan Makkans even believed in the Resurrection and the Judgement and
others in predestination ( _qadar_ ). Ample evidence of their belief can be found in
pre-Islamic poetry. for example, the poet Zuhayr was reported to have said: about
punishment:

```
“It is either delayed, placed in a book and saved for the Day of
Judgement, or hastened and (injustice) avenged.”
```
‘Antarah was quoted as saying:

```
“O ‘Ebil, to where will you run from death, if my Lord in the sky has
destined it?”^40
```
In spite of the Makkan’s confession of _tawheed_ and their knowledge of Allaah,
Allaah classified them as disbelievers ( _kuffaar_ ) and pagans ( _mushrikoon_ ) simply
because they worshipped other gods along with their worship of Allaah.

Consequently, the most important aspect of _tawheed_ is that of _tawheed al-
’Ibaadah,_ maintaining the unity of Allaah’s worship. All forms of worship must
be directed only to Allaah because He alone deserves worship, and it is He alone
who can grant benefit to man as a result of His worship. Furthermore, there is no
need for any form of intercessor or intermediary between man and God. Allaah
exmphasized the importance of directing worship to Him alone by pointing out
that this was the main purpose of man’s creation and the essence of the message
brought by all the prophet. He said:

```
“Verily, We have sent to every nation a messenger (saying),
‘Worship Allaah and avoid false gods.”^42
```
Understanding the purpose of creation in a complete sense is beyond man’s innate
abilities. Man is a finite created being and cannot reasonably hope to fully
comprehend the actions of the infinite Creator. Hence, God made it a part of
man’s nature to worship Him, and He sent prophets and books of divine
revelation to clarify the aspect of the purpose of creation which was within man’s
mental ability to grasp. That purpose is, as previously mentioned: the worship of
God (‘ _ebaadah_ ) and the main message of the prophets was to worship God alone,
( _Tawheed al-’Ibaadah_ ). Consequently, the gravest sin is _shirk,_ the worship of
others instead of Allaah or along with Allaah.

In Soorah al-Faatihah, which every Muslim is required to recite in his or
her daily prayers, verse four reads, **“You alone do we worship, and from You
alone do we seek help.”** This is a clear statement that all forms of worship should
be directed exclusively to the One who can respond: Allaah. The Prophet
Muhammad (r) confirmed the concept of unity of worship saying, _“If you ask in
prayer ask only Allaah, and if you seek help, seek it only from Allaah.”_^43 The
absence of any need for intercession is further emphasized by the any verses
indicating His closeness to man. For example:

forms of intercession or association of partners with Allaah. If someone prays to

the dead seeking their influence on the lives of the living or the souls of those who
have passed away, they have associated a partner with Allaah, because worship is
being shared between Allaah and His creation. The Prophet Muhammad (r) said,
in no uncertain terms, _“Prayer (du‘aa_ ) _is worship.”_^46 And, Allaah, Most Great
and Glorious, said:

If someone prays to the Prophet (r), or to jinn, angels or so called saints asking
for help or asking them to request help from Allaah on his behalf, be has also
committed _shirk._ The concept of “Ghaus-i-Azam” ( _al-Ghawth al-A‘dHam_ ), a title
given by the ignorant to ‘Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee,^49 is also an expression of
_shirk_ in this form of _tawheed._ The title literally means “the greatest source of
rescue; the one most able to save someone from danger,” and such a description
only belongs to Allaah. When misfortune occurs, some people call on ‘Abdul-
Qaadir by this title seeking his aid and protection, even though Allaah has already

strictly orthodox with some, mystic interpretations of the Qur’aan. Ibn ‘Arabee (born 1165)
declared him the _Qutb_ of his time and stated that he had a rank which placed him above all beings
except God. ‘Alee ibn Yousuf ash-Shattanawfee (d. 1314 CE) wrote a book called _Bahjat al-
Asraar_ (Cairo, 1304) in which he attributed many miracles to ‘Abdul-Qaadir. The Qaadireeyah
Sufi order is named after him and its spiritual exercises and regulations traced back to him.

According to the Qur’aan, when the Makkans were questioned about directing
their prayers to their idols, they answered,

###### زلﹾفﹶى اللَّ هِ إِلﹶى لِيقﹶربونا إِلَّ ا نعبدهم ما

```
“We only worship them so that they may bring us closer to
Allaah.”^51
```
The idols were only used as intermediaries yet Allaah called them pagans for their
practice. Those among Muslims who insist on praying to other than Allaah would
do well to reflect on this fact.

Christians, influenced by the teachings of Saul from Tarsus (later called
Paul), deified Prophet Jesus and directed their prayer to him and his mother. The
Catholics among Christians have saints for every occasion to whom they direct
their prayers in the belief that these saints can directly influence the affairs of this
world. The Catholics also use their priests as intercessors between themselves and
Allaah in the mistaken belief that the priests are closer to Allaah due to their
celibacy and piety, and thus more likely to be listened to by Allaah. Most _Shi‘ite_
sects have devoted certain days of the week and hours of the day for prayer to
‘Alee, Faatimah, Hasan and Husayn^52 due to their distorted belief in intercession.

Worship (‘ _ebaadah_ ) in the Islamic view, includes more than just fasting,
paying _zakaah,_ Hajj and animal sacrifices. It includes emotions like love, trust,
and fear, all of which have degrees which should only be directed to God. Allaah
has addressed these emotions and warned against excesses in them as follows:

Since the term _‘Ibaadah_ means total obedience, and Allaah is considered the
ultimate lawgiver, the implementation of secular legal systems not based on
divine law ( _Sharee‘ah_ ) is an act of disbelief in the divine law and belief in the
correctness of such systems. Such a belief constitutes a form of worshipping other
than Allaah ( _shirk_ ). Allaah said in the Qur’aan:

_On one occasion, the Prophet’s companion, ‘Adee ibn Haatim, who was a convert
from Christianity, heard the Prophet (r) recite the Qur’anic verse,_

“They have taken their rabbis and monks as lords besides Allaah,”^57

_so he said: ‘Surely we did not worship them.” The Prophet (r) turned to him and
said ‘Did they not make forbidden (_ **_haraam_** _) what Allaah had made allowable

made_ **_haraam_**^59 _and you made it_ **_halaal_** _?’ He replied, ‘We certainly did.’ The
Prophet (r) then said, ‘That was how you worshipped them.”_^60

Hence, a significant part of _Tawheed al-‘Ibaadah_ involves the
implementation of _Sharee‘ah,_ especially in lands where Muslims form the

majority of the population. Divine law should be re-introduced in the many
Muslims countries where governments now rule according to imported capitalist
or communist constitutions, and Islamic law is either totally extinct or relegated to
a few areas of minor importance. Likewise, Muslim countries where Islamic law
is on the books but secular laws are in force, should implement the _Sharee‘ah_ as it
pertains to all aspects of life. The implementation of non-Islamic rule in place of
_Sharee‘ah_ in Muslim lands is an act of _shirk_ and _kufr_ as indicated by the
previously quoted verse_._ However, as Ibn ‘Abbaas explained, it is not the major
act of disbelief which takes one out of the fold of Islaam but a lesser form.
Consequently, ruling by non-Islamic law does not automatically make the doer a
disbeliever unless he or she actually believes that non-Islamic laws are superior or
equal to divine law. Therefore, the currently common practice of some extreme
groups of declaring all Muslim rulers and those who work under them to be
disbelievers ( _takfeer_ ) simply because they uphold un-Islamic systems is incorrect.
However, it is the duty of those in positions of authority to change such systems,
while those in positions of influence should advise the rulers in a way which
would not incite rebellion and bloodshed among the masses_._ As for those not in
such positions, they should despise un-Islamic government for the pleasure of
God and for the upholding of _tawheed._


```
1.2 THE CATEGORIES OF SHIRK
```
The study of tawheed cannot be considered complete without a careful analysis of
its opposite, shirk. Some mention of shirk has already been made in the previous
chapter and examples of it have been given to illustrate how tawheed may be
obliterated. However, in this chapter shirk will be looked at as a separate topic
whose grave importance Allaah has attested to in the Qur’aan:

## يشاءُ لِمن ذﹶلِك دونﹶ ما ويغفِر بِهِ يشرك أﹶنﹾ يغفِر لﹶا اللَّ ه إِنَّ

```
“ Surely Allaah will not forgive the association of partners (shirk)
with Him, but He forgives (sins) lesser then that of whomever He
wishes. ”^1
```
Because the sin of shirk denies the very purpose of man’s creation, it is to God the
gravest of sins, the unforgiveable sin.

Shirk literally means partnership, sharing or associating,^2 but Islamically it
refers to the act of assigning partners to Allaah in whatever form it may take. The
following analysis of shirk will correspond to the three broad categories
developed in the study of tawheed. Hence, we will first look at the main ways in
which shirk can occur in the area of ruboobeeyah (lordship), then asmaa _’_ was-
sifaat (divine names and attributes), and finally in _‘_ Ibaadah (worship).

Shirk in Ruboobeeyah

This category of shirk refers to either the belief that others share Allaah’s lordship
over creation as His equal or near equal, or to the belief that there exists no lord
over creation at all. Most religious systems fall into the first sub-category of shirk
in Ruboobeeyah while it is the philosophers and their man-made philosophies that
tend to fill the second one.

(^1) Soorah an-Nisaa, (4):48.
(^2) The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, p.468.


(a) Shirk by Association: Beliefs that exemplify shirk by association are ones in
which a main God or Supreme Being over creation is recognized, though His
dominion is shared by other lesser gods, spirits, mortals, heavenly bodies or
earthly objects. Such belief systems are commonly referred to by theologians and
philosophers as either monotheistic (having one god) or polytheistic (having more
then one god). According to Islaam, all of these systems are polytheistic, and
many represent various stages in the degeneration of divinely revealed religious
systems, which were all originally based on tawheed.

Within Hinduism the Supreme Being, Brahman is conceived as
indwelling, all-pervading, unchangeable and eternal, the abstract, impersonal
Absolute, in which all things have their origin and end. On the other hand the god
Brahma is the personified creator of the universe who forms a trinity with the
preserver god, Vishnu and the destroyer god, Shiva.^3 Thus, Shirk in Ruboobeeyah
is-expressed in Hiduism by the delegation of God’s creative, destructive and
preservative powers to other gods.

Christian belief states that the one God reveals himself in the three persons
of Father, Son (Jesus Christ) and Holy Sprit. These three persons are nevertheless
regarded as a unity, sharing one ‘substance.’^4 Prophet Jesus is elevated to divinity,
sits on the right hand of God and judges the world. The Holy Spirit, which in the
Hebrew Bible is the means by which God exercises His creative power, in
Christian thought becomes a part of the God-head. Paul made the Holy Spirit the
alter ego of Christ, the guide and help of Christians, first manifesting itself on the
day of Penetecost.^5 Consequently, Shirk in Ruboobeeyah occurs in the Christian
belief that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are God’s partners in all of His dominion, in
their belief that Jesus alone pronounces judgement on the world, and in their
belief that Christians are helped and guided by the Holy Spirit.

Zoroastrians (Parsis) conceive of God, Ahura Mazda, as being the creator
of all that is good, and is alone worthy of absolute worship. Fire is one of the
seven creations of Ahura Mazda and is considered his son or representative. But
they also commit Shirk in Ruboobeeyah by conceiving of evil, violence and death
ad being the creation of another god called Angra Mainyu whom they represent
by the symbol darkness.^6 Hence, God’s sovereignty over all creation (i.e. His

ruboobeeyah) is shared with an evil spirit elevated to the level of an opposing god
due to man’s desire not to attribute evil to God.

In the Yoruba religion, followed by over 10 million people in West Africa
(mainly Nigeria), there is one supreme God, Olorius (Lord of Heaven) or
Olodumare. Nevertheless, modern Yoruba religion is characterized by a great
many forms of Orisha worship, so that it appears as strict polytheism.^7
Consequently, Yorubas commit Shirk in Ruboobeeyah by turning over all of
God’s functions to minor gods and spirits.

The Zulus of South Africa believe in one God, Unkulunkulu, meaning the
ancient, the first, the most revered one. The principal specific titles for God are
Nkosi yaphezulu (Lord of the Sky) and Muvelingqanqi (the first to appear). Their
supreme Being is represented as a male, who along with the earth female, brings
forth the human world. Thunder and lightening are in the Zulu religion acts of
God, whereas sickness and other troubles in life may be caused by ancestors, the
idlozi or abaphansi (those under the earth). The ancestors also protect, punish, or
neglect the living, ask for food, are pleased with ritual and sacrifice, and take
possession of fortune tellers (inyanga).^8 Thus, Shirk in Ruboobeeyah occurs in the
Zulu religion not only in their concept of the creation of the human world, but
also in their attribution of good and evil in human life to the work of ancestral
spirits.

Among some Muslims people, Shirk in Ruboobeeyah is manifested in
their belief that the souls of saints and other righteous humans can affect the
affairs of this world, even after their deaths. Their souls, it is believed, can fulfil
one’s needs, remove calamities, and aid whoever calls on them. Thus grave
worshippers assign to human souls the divine ability to cause events in this life
which in fact only Allaah can cause.

Common among many Sufis (Muslim mystics) is the belief in _“_ Rijaal al-
Ghayb _”_^9 (men of the unseen) the chief of whom occupies the station called
_“_ Qutub _”_ from which the affairs of this world are governed.^10

(b) Shirk by Negation This sub-category represents the various philosophies and
ideologies which deny the existence of God either explicitly or implicitly. That is,
in some cases God’s non-existence is stated (atheism), while in other cases His

existence is claimed, but the way in which He is conceived actually denies His
existence (pantheism).

There are a few ancient religious systems in which God does not exist,
foremost among them being the system attributed to Gautama Buddha. Buddhism,
a reformist movement in Hinduism opposed to the caste system, was founded in
the 6th century B.C. during the same period as Jainism. During the 3rd century
B.C. it became the state religion. Eventually it was assimilated by Hinduism,
Buddha himself becoming one of the avatars (incarnations of God). It disappeared
from India but became dominant in China and other Eastern nations. Hinayana
Buddhism (400-250 B.C.), the earlier and more strict of the two interpretations of
Buddhism which arose after Gautama Buddha’s death, makes it clear that there is
no God; hence the burden of salvation belongs to the individual alone.^11 Thus, this
ancient strain of Buddhism may be cited as an example of Shirk in Ruboobeeyah
wherein God’s existence is explicity denied.

Similarly, in the teachings of Jainism as systematized by Vardhamana,
there is no God, but liberated souls achieve something of this status, having
immortality and omniscience; and the religious community treats the liberated
ones as though they were divine, building temples to them and venerating their
images.^12

Another ancient example is that of the Pharaoh of Prophet Moses’ time.
Allaah mentioned in the Qur’aan that he negated the existence of God and
claimed to Moses and the people of Egypt that he, Pharaoh, was the only true lord
of all creation. Allaah quoted him as saying to Moses,

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries a number of European philosophers
asserted the non-existence of God in what became know as the “death of God
philosophy.” The German philosopher Philipp Mainlander (1841-1876) in his

(^13) Soorah ash-Shooraa, (26):29.
(^14) Soorah an-Naazi‘aat, (79):24.


principal writing, The Philosophy of Redemption, 1876), states that the world
begins with the death of God, since God is a principle of unity shattered in the
plurality of the world and a principle of joy denied in the law of suffering which
dominates the world.^15 In Prussia, Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) supported the
idea of the “death of God” proposing that God was nothing more than a projection
of man’s uneasy conscience and that man was the bridge to the superman.^16 Jeal
Paul Sartre, a French philosopher of the twentieth century, also echoed the “death
of God” thought. He claimed that God could not exist because He was a
contradiction in terms. The idea of God, according to him, is a projection which
man must make, being what he is.^17

Darwin’s (d. 1882) proposal that man was merely a glorified ape was
widely adopted in the theories of social scientists and philosophers of the
nineteenth century as it provided a “scientific” basis for the non-existence of God.
According to them religion evolved from animism to monotheism along with
man’s supposed social evolution from an independant individual to a national
state and his physical evolution from ape to man.

Evolutionists attempt to escape the questions surrounding creation by
claiming that there was none, and by assigning Allaah’s attribute of being without
beginning and end to matter itself which He has created. Present day holders of
this belief are the followers of Karl Marx, Communists and scientific socialists,
who claim that the origin of everything in existence is matter in motion. They
further claim that God is figment of man’s imagination, created by the ruling
classes to justify their hereditary rule and divert the attention of the oppressed
masses from the realities in which they live.

An example of this form of shirk among Muslims is that of many Sufis
such as Ibn ‘Arabee, who claim that only Allaah exists. (All is Allaah, and Allaah
is all). They deny the separate identity of Allaah and thereby in fact deny His
existence. This idea was also expressed in the 17th century by the Dutch Jewish
philosopher, Baruch Spinoza, who claimed that God is the total of all parts of the
universe including man.

_Shirk_ in al-Asmaa was-Sifaat

Shirk in this category includes both the common pagan practice of giving
Allaah the attributes of His creation as well as the act of giving created beings
Allaah’s names and attributes.

(^15) Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion, p.327.
(^16) Ibid., p.391.
(^17) Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion, pp.508-9.


(a) Shirk by Humanization

In this aspect of Shirk in al-Asmaa _’_ was-Sifaat, Allaah is given the form
and qualities of human beings and animals. Due to man’s superiority over
animals, the human form is more commonly used by idolaters to represent God in
creation. Consequently, the image of the Creator is often painted, moulded or
carved in the shape of human beings possessing the physical features of those
who worship them. For example, Hindus and Buddhists worship countless idols in
the likeness of Asian men and consider them manifestations of God in creation.
Modern day Christian belief that the Prophet Jesus was God incarnate — that the
Creator became His creation — is another good example of this type of Shirk.
There have been many reckoned Christian painters like Michaelangelo (d. 1565),
who painted pictures of God as a naked old European man with long flowing
white hair and beard on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. These
pictures have, in turn, been held by the Christian world in the highest esteem.

(b). Shirk by Deification This form of Shirk in al-Asmaa _’_ was-Sifaat relates to
cases where created beings or things are given, or claim, Allaah’s names or His
attributes. For example, it was the practice of the ancient Arabs to worship idols
whose names were derived from the names of Allaah. Their three main idols
were: al-Laat, taken from Allaah’s name al-Elaah; al-‘Uzza, taken from al-
‘Azeez; and al-Manaat, taken from al-Mannaan. During the Prophet Muhammad’s
era there was also a false prophet in a region of Arabic called Yamaamah, who
took the name Rahmaan which only belongs to Allaah.

Among the Shi _‘_ ite sects is the Nusayreeyah of Syria, who believe that the
Prophet Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law, ‘Alee ibn Abee Taalib, was a
manifestation of Allaah and give him many of Allaah’s qualities. Among them
too are the Ismaai _‘_ ils, also known as Agha Khanis, who consider their leader, the
Agha Khan, to be God incarnate. Also include in this category are the Druze of
Lebanon who believe that the Faatimid Caliph al-Haakim bi Amrillaah, was the
last manifestation of Allaah among mankind.

Claims of Sufis (Muslim mystics) like al-Hallaaj that they have become
one with God and as such exist as manifestations of the Creator within His
creation may also be included in this aspect of Shirk in al-Asmaa _’_ was-Sifaat.
Modern-day spiritualists and mediums, such as Shirley Maclaine and J.Z. Knight,
often claim divinity for themselves as well as mankind in general. Einstein’s
theory of relativity (E=mc^2 , energy is equal to mass times the square of the speed
of light) taught in all schools, is in fact an expression of Shirk in al-Asmaa _’_ waas-
Sifaat. The theory states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it


merely transforms into matter and vice versa. However, both matter and energy
are created entities and they both will be destroyed, as Allaah clearly states:

## شيءٍ كﹸلِّ خالِق اللَّ ه

```
“ Allaah is the creator of all things... ”^18
```
## فﹶانٍ علﹶيها من كﹸلُّ

```
“ Everything in (the world) will perish... ”^19
```
The theory also implies that mass and energy are eternal having no beginning or
end since they are supposed to be uncreated and transform into each other.
However, this attribute belongs only to Allaah who alone is without beginning or
end.

Darwin’s theory of evolution is also an attempt to explain the evolution of
life and its forms from lifeless matter without the intervention of God. One of the
leading Darwinists of this century, Sir Aldous Huxley expressed this thought as
follows:

```
“Darwinism removed the whole idea of God as the creator of organisms
from the sphere of rational discussion.”^20
```
_Shirk_ in al-‘Ebaadah

In this category of shirk, acts of worship are directed to other than God
and the reward for worship is sought from the creation instead of the Creator. As
in the case of the previous categories, Shirk in al- _’_ Ibaadah has two main aspects.

(a) Ash-Shirk al-Akbar (Major Shirk)

This form of shirk occurs when any act or worship is directed to other than
Allaah. It represents the most obvious form of idolatry, which the prophets were

p.254 from Tax and Callender, 1960, vol.III, p.45.


specifically sent by Allaah to call the masses of mankind away from. This concept
is supported by Allaah’s statement in the Qur’aan:

## الطَّ اغﹸوت واجتنِبوا اللَّ ه اﹸعبدوا أﹶنﹾ رسولﹰا أﹸمةٍ كﹸلِّ فِي بعثﹾنا ولﹶقﹶد

```
“ Surely we have sent to every nation a messenger saying, worship
Allaah and avoid taaghoot (false gods). ”^21
```
Taaghoot actually means anything which is worshipped along with Allaah or
instead of Allaah. For example, love is a form of worship which, in its perfection,
should only be directed to Allaah. In Islaam, the love of God is expressed by total
obedience to Him. It is not the type of love which man naturally feels toward
creation; towards parents, children, food, etc. To direct that type of love towards
God is to lower Him to the level of His creation which is Shirk in al-Asmaa _’_ was-
Sifaat. Love that is worship is the total surrender of one’s will to God.
Consequently, Allaah told the Prophet (r) to tell the believers:

## اللَّ ه يحبِبكﹸم فﹶاتبِعونِي اللَّ ه تحِبونﹶ كﹸنتم إِنﹾ قﹸلﹾ

```
‘ Say: If you love Allaah, follow me and Allaah will love you. ”^22
```
The Prophet (r) also told his companions, _“_ None of you is a true believer until I
become more beloved to him than his child, his father and the whole of mankind.^23
Love of the Prophet (r) is not based on his humanity but on the divine origin of
his message. Thus, like the love of Allaah, it is also expressed by total obedience
to his commands. Allaah said in the final revelation:

## اللَّ ه أﹶطﹶاع فﹶقﹶد الرسولﹶ يطِع من

```
“ Whoever obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allaah. ” 24 and
```
## ولﹶوالرس اللَّ ه أﹶطِيعوا قﹸلﹾ

```
“ Say: Obey Allaah and obey the Prophet... ”^25
```
If man allows the love of anything or anyone to come between himself and
Allaah, then he has worshipped that thing, In this way, money can become one’s
god or even one’s desires could become a god. The Prophet (r) said, _“_ The

worshipper of the dirham will always be miserable, _”_^26 and Allaah said in the
Qur’aan,

## هواه إِلﹶهه اتخذﹶ من أﹶرأﹶيت

```
“ Have you not seen the one who takes his desires as his god? ”^27
```
Much emphasis has been placed on the evils of Shirk in _‘_ Ibaadah (worship)
because it contradicts the very purpose of creation as expressed in Allaah’s
statement:

## لِيعبدونِي إِلَّ ا والﹾإِنس الﹾجِن خلﹶقﹾت وما

```
“ I have not created Jinn or mankind except for My worship. ”^28
```
Major shirk represents the greatest act of rebellion against the Lord of the
Universe, and is thus the ultimate sin. It is a sin so great that it virtually cancels
out all good a person may do and guarantees its perpetrator eternal damnation in
Hell. Consequently, false religion is based primarily on this form of shirk. All
man-made systems in one way or another invite their followers to the worship of
creation. Christians are called upon to pray to a man, a Prophet of God named
Jesus, whom they claim to have been God incarnate. Catholics among Christians
pray to Mary as the “mother of God”, to angels like Michael who is honored on
September 29 (Michaelmas Day)^29 as well as to human saints, whether real or
fictitious.

Muslims whose acts of worship fall into this category of shirk are those
who pray to Prophet Muhammad (r) or to mystics in the Sufi hierarchy of saints,
believing that they can answer their prayers, though Allaah has clearly said in the
Qur’aan:

**تمكﹸن إِنﹾ تدعونﹶ اللَّ هِ أﹶغﹶير الساعةﹸ أﹶتتكﹸم أﹶو اللَّ هِ عذﹶاب أﹶتاكﹸم إِنﹾ أﹶرأﹶيتكﹸم قﹸلﹾ**

“ Say: Think to yourselves; if there came upon you Allaah ’ s
punishment or the Final Hour, would you then call on other than

```
(b) Ash-Shirk al-Asghar (Minor Shirk) Mahmood ibn Lubayd reported,
“Allaah’s Messenger (r) said: The thing I fear for you the most is ash-shirk al-
asghar (minor shirk). The companions asked O Messenger of Allaah, what is
minor shirk? He replied, **_‘_** Ar-Riyaa **_’_** (showing off), for verily Allaah will say on
the Day of Resurrection when people are receiving their rewards, _“_ Go to those
for whom you were showing off in the material world and see if you can find any
reward from them. _’”’_^31

Mahmood ibn Lubayd also said, _“_ The Prophet ( _r_ ) came out and announced, _‘_ O
people, beware of secret shirk! **_’_** The people asked, _‘_ O Messenger of Allaah, what
is secret shirk? **_’_** He replied, _‘_ When a man gets up to pray and strives to beautify
his prayer because people are looking at him, that is secret shirk. **_’”_**^32

Ar-Riyaa **_’_**

Riyaa _’_ is the practice of performing any of the various forms of worship in
order to be seen and praised by people. This sin destroys all the benefits that lie in
righteous deeds and brings on the one who commits it a serious punishment. It is
particularly dangerous, because it is natural for man to desire and enjoy the praise
of his fellow men. Doing religious acts to impress people or in order to be praised
by them is, therefore, an evil which deserves man’s utmost caution. This danger is
really significant to the believers, whose goal is to make all of the acts of their
lives religious acts dedicated to God. In fact, the likelihood that knowledgeable
true believers would commit ash-shirk al-akbar is small, since its pitfalls are so
obvious.. However, for the true believer like everyone else, the chance of
committing riyaa _’_ s is great because it is so hidden. It only involves the simple act
of changing one’s intention. The motivating forces behind it are also very strong,
since it comes from man’s inner nature. Ibn ‘Abbaas alluded to this reality when
he said, _“_ Shirk is more hidden than a black ant creeping on a black stone in the
middle of a moonless night. _”_^33

Thus, great care has to be taken to ensure that one’s intentions begin pure and
remain pure whenever righteous deeds are being done. In order to ensure this, the

saying of Allaah’s name is enjoined in Islaam before all acts of importance. A
series of du _’_ aas (informal prayers) have also been prescribed by the Prophet (r)
before and after all natural habits like eating, drinking, sleeping, sex, and even
going to the toilet, in order to turn these everyday habits into acts of worship and
develop in Muslims a keen awareness of Allaah. It is this awareness, called
taqwaa, which ultimately insures that intentions remain pure.

The Prophet (r) also provided protection against the inevitable acts of
shirk by teaching certain specific prayers which may be said anytime. Abu
Moosaa said, _“_ One day Allaah _’_ s Messenger delivered a sermon, saying, _‘_ O
people, fear shirk for it is more hidden than the creeping of an ant. _’_ Those whom
Allaah wished asked, _‘_ And how do we avoid it when it is more hidden than the
creeping of an ant, O Messenger of Allaah? _’_ He replied, _‘_ Say:

###### نَعْلَمھُ لاَ لَمِا وَنَسْتَغْفِرُكَ نَعْلُمَھُ شَیْئاً نُشْركَ أَنْ بِكَ نَعوُذُ إنَّ ا الّھُمَّ

Allaahumma innaa na _‘_ oodhu bika an nushrika bika shay _’_ an na _‘_ lamuh, wa
nastaghfiruka limaa laa na _‘_ lamuh. (O Allaah, we seek refuge in your from
knowingly committing shirk with you, and we ask your forgiveness for what we
do not know about).”^34

In the following chapters a more detailed look will be taken at the most
prominent areas in which shirk in its three aspects most commonly occurs.

(^34) Collected by Ahmad and at-Tabaraanee.


mong the community of believers, some are superior to others; and this
superiority is a direct result of their own strivings. It is a superiority linked to
Eemaan, the strength and depth of faith. A living faith drives the one who
possesses it to shield himself from whatever displeases Allaah. This shield in
Arabic is called. _“_ Taqwaa. _”_ It has been variously translated as “fear of God”,
“piety”, as well as “God-consciousness”; and it carries all these meanings and
more. Allaah clearly expressed the superiority of Taqwaa as follows:

###### أﹶتقﹶاكﹸم اللَّ هِ عِند أﹶكﹾرمكﹸم إِنَّ

```
“ Verily the most noble among you is the one with the most
Taqwaa. ”^1
```
Allaah is here saying that the only factor which makes a believing man or woman
truly superior to another is the level of Taqwaa. It is this piety or fear of God
which elevates man from the level of “thinking animal” to that of governor
(Khaleefah) of the planets. The importance of the fear of Allaah in a Muslim’s life
cannot be overstressed. Allaah mentioned Taqwaa and its derivatives 26 times in
the Qur’aan, everywhere emphasizing that Taqwaa is the driving force behind
living faith. Without it, faith is only a meaningless jumble of memorized words
and phrases, and ‘righteous’ deeds only shells of pretence and hypocrisy.
Consequently, piety is preferred over all other consideration in all of life’s
transactions. The Messenger of Allaah (r) said: _“_ A woman is married for four
(reasons): her wealth, her nobility, her beauty, and he piety. Choose the pious one
and be successful. _”_^2 No matter how beautiful, rich or well bred a woman might
be, if she is not pious, she is inferior to a pious, ugly, poor woman from a
dishonorable family. The converse is also true, as the Prophet (r) said, _“_ If a man
whose practise of the religion satisfies you, asks you for your daughter in
marriage, you should marry them; otherwise there will be corruption in the
land. _”_^3

1.3 SAINT AND GRAVE WORSHIP

### A


The Prophet (r) once reprimanded Abu Dharr for derisively calling Bilal, ‘son of
a black woman’, then he went on to say, _“_ Look! Surely you are not better than a
brown man nor a black man except by fearing Allaah more then them. _”_^4 This
understanding was hammered home time and time again by Allaah’s Messenger
(r). Even in the Farewell Pilgrimage, done shortly before he died, he lectured the
people on the insignificance of racial differences and the all importance of
Taqwaa.

The most pious individuals are only known to Allaah, because the seat of Taqwaa
is the heart. Man can only judge people by each other’s outward deeds which may
or may not be misleading. Allaah made that abundantly clear in the following
verse:

**أﹶلﹶد وهو قﹶلﹾبِهِ فِي ما علﹶى اللَّ ه ويشهِد الدنيا الﹾحياةِ فِي قﹶولﹸه يعجِبك من الناسِ ومِن**

###### الﹾخِصامِ

```
“ There is among people in this life, he whose speech will dazzle you.
And he will call on Allaah as a witness to what is in his heart; yet, he
will be among the most vicious of enemies. ”^5
```
Therefore, it is not permissible for humans to designate certain people as being
particularly saintly and pious to a degree beyond the reach of ordinary humans.
The Prophet Muhammad (r) specified among his companions (Sahaabah) some
whom he gave glad tidings of paradise in this life.^6 However, such
pronouncements were based on revelation and not his own ability to judge the
hearts. For example, when the (r) said concerning those who make a pledge of
allegiance known as Bay _‘_ ah ar-Ridwaan, _“_ No one who made the pledge beneath
the tree will enter the hellfire, _”_^7 he was confirming the Qur’anic verse revealed to
that effect:

**جرةِالش تحت يبايِعونك إِذﹾ الﹾمؤمِنِين عن اللَّ ه رضِي لﹶقﹶد**

```
“ Allaah is pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to
you beneath the tree. ”^8
```
(^4) Reported by ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr and collected by Ahmed.
(^5) Soorah al-Baqarah, (2):204.
(^6) Among them are ten well known, Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan, ‘Alee, Talhah, az-Zubayr, Sa‘d
ibn Abee Waqqaas, Sa‘eed in Zayd, ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf, Abu ‘Ubaydah ibn al-Jaarraah
(see al- _‘_ Aqeedah at-Tahaaweeyah, pp.485-7).
(^7) Reported by Jaabir and collected by Muslim (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), vol.3, p.1034,
no.4576).
(^8) Soorah al-Fat-h, (48):18.


Similarly, he judged some whom everyone thought were destined to paradise to
be among those destined for the hellfire. All such judgements were based on
revelation. Ibn ‘Abbaas said that he was told by ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab that on the
day of (the battle) of Khaybar, some of the Prophet _’_ s companions came and said,
_“_ So and so is a martyr and so and so is a martyr, _”_ but when they came to a man
about whom they said, _“_ So and so is a martyr, _”_ Allaah _’_ s messenger declared,
_“_ By no means! I have seen him in hell in a cloak which he took (from the spoils)
dishonestly. _”_ Allaah _’_ s messenger then said, _“_ Go, Ibn al-Khattaab, and announce
among the people three times that only the believers will enter paradise. _”_^9

In Christian tradition down through the ages, some individuals were highly
praised for their supposed spiritual achievements. Miracles were attributed to
them and the rank of “saint” was bestowed on them. In pre-Christian Hindu and
Buddhist tradition, teachers who were supposed to have climbed the ladder of
spiritual excellence and who had performed supernatural feats were also given
titles like Guru, Avatar, etc., indicating spiritual superiority. These designations
have led the masses to either seek intercession through them or two worship them
as goes. Consequently, these religious traditions have lists of saints to whom the
masses fervently pray. Islaam, on the other hand, opposes even the excessive
praise of Prophet Muhammad (r) who said, _“_ Do not praise me excessively as the
Christians did to _‘_ Eesaa ibn Maryam, verily I am only a slave, so call me instead
the slave of Allaah and His messenger. _”_^10

_Walee_ : The “Saint”

The term saint has been used to translate the Arabic word Walee (pl. Awliyaa)
which Allaah used to designate those who are close to Him. But, a more
appropriate translation is “close friend” because Walee literally means an “ally.”
Allaah even uses it to refer to Himself in the verse:

###### النورِ إِلﹶى الظُّ لﹸماتِ مِن يخرِجهم اآمنو الَّ ذِين ولِي اللَّ ه

```
“ Allaah is the Walee of those who believe and takes them from the
darkness into light. ”^11
```
He also uses it to refer to Satan as in the verse:

(^9) Collected by Muslim. See Sahih Muslim (English Trans.) vol.1, p.65, no.209.
(^10) Reported by ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and collected by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim (See Sahih Al-
Bukhari (Arabic-English), vol.4, p.435, no.654).
(^11) Soorah al-Baqarah, (2):257, 3:68, 42:9 and 45:19.

```
“ Whoever takes Satan as a Walee instead of Allaah, has clearly lost
all. ”^12
```
This term also means “close relative” as in the following verse:

###### الﹾقﹶتلِ فِي يسرِف فﹶلﹶا سلﹾطﹶانا لِولِيهِ جعلﹾنا فﹶقﹶد

```
“ We have given power to the Walee of whoever is wrongly killed, but
do not be excessive in the execution (of the murderer). ”^13
```
It is also used in Qur’aan to indicate closeness between men, for example,

###### الﹾمؤمِنِين دونِ مِن أﹶولِياءَ الﹾكﹶافِرِين الﹾمؤمِنونﹶ يتخِذﹾ لﹶا

```
“ The believers should not take the disbelievers as Awliyaa instead of
other believers. ”^14
```
But the usage which concerns us most is _“_ Awliyaa-ullaah _”_ close friends of
Allaah. In the Qur’aan Allaah has designated among mankind certain types of
individuals whom He considers especially close to Himself. Allaah’s description
of His Walees can be found in Soorah al-Anfaal where Allaah states:

###### يعلﹶمونﹶ لﹶا أﹶكﹾثﹶرهم ولﹶكِن الﹾمتقﹸونﹶ إِلَّ ا أﹶولِياؤه إِنﹾ

```
“ Verily His (Allaah ’ s) Awliyaa are only those with Taqwaa, but most
people do not realize that. ”^15

“ Behold! Certainly no fear nor grief shall overcome that Awliyaa of

Allaah explains for us that the criterion for _“_ Walaayah _”_ (divine friendship) is
Eemaan (faith) and Taqwaa (piety) and these qualities are shared by all true
believers.^17 Among the ignorant masses, the main criterion for Walaayah

(“Sainthood”) is the performance of miracles which are commonly called
Karaamaat to distinguish them from the miracles Mu _‘_ jizaat of the prophets. To
most who hold this belief, the faith and practise of the “miracle” worker are of no
consequence. Hence, some who have been designated “saints” held heretical
beliefs and practises, while others were known to have abandoned the religious
rituals, and, yet others were even involved in licentious and vulgar behaviour.
However, nowhere has Allaah made the working of miracles a stipulation for
being His Walee. Therefore, as earlier states, all believers who have Eemaan and
Taqwaa are Walees of Allaah and He is their Walee, as Allaah Himself said,

###### آمنوا الَّ ذِين ولِي اللَّ ه

“ Allaah is the Walee of those who believe. ”^18
```
Consequently, Muslims are not allowed to designate certain believers as belong
Awliyaa of Allaah and not others. In spite of this clear Islamic position, a
hierarchy of so-called Muslims saints has become a prominent feature in Sufi
circles and among the masses who blindly follow them. In ascending order of
merit they are: the Akhyaar (chosen) who number 300; the Abdaal (substitutes)
numbering 40; the 7 Abraar (pious); the 4 Awtaad (pegs); the 3 Nuqabaa
(watchmen), the Qutb (pole) who is considered the greatest saint of his time, and
at the top of the list is the Ghawth (Succor), the greatest of Saints, who is
believed, in some circles, to be capable of taking on his shoulders a portion of the
sins of the believers. According to the belief of “mystics”, the saints of the top
three classes are present invisibly in Makkah at the hours of prayer. When the
Ghawth dies, the Qutb replaces him and there is a moving up all through the
series, the purest soul of each class rising to the next degree.^19 This body of
mythology has been borrowed from Christianity, just as Dhikr beads were
adopted from the Christian rosary, and Mawlid from the Christian celebration of
Christmas.

Fanaa: The Union of Man With God

A close look at various lists of the most prominent so-called saints, reveals names
like that of al-Hallaaj who was publicly executed as an apostate for daring to
openly claim divinity in his infamous pronouncement _“_ Anal-Haqq _”_ ‘I am the
Reality’ when Allaah already said:

```
“ That is so, because Allaah is the Reality and it is He who gives life

```
What led this deranged individual to make such a pronouncement was his belief
in a principle very similar to the ultimate state of being in Buddhism known as
_“_ Nirvana. _”_^21 In this state, according to a branch of Buddhist thought, the ego
disappears and the human soul and consciousness are extinguished.^22

This concept also forms the core of a philosophy known as “mysticism.”
Mysticism^23 is defined as an experience of union with God and the belief that
man’s main goal lies in the seeking that union The origins of mysticism can be
found in the writings of ancient Greek philosophers like Plato _’_ s Symposium in
which mention is made of various ladders of ascent, composed of step and hard
steps, whereby a union of the soul with God is finally attained.^24 A parallel
concept can also be found in Hinduism’s identification of Atman (human soul)
with Brahman (the impersonal Absolute), the realization of which is the ultimate
goal or release from existence and rebirth.^25 Greek mystic thought blossomed in
the Gnostic Christian movements which, like that of Valentinus (c. 140 CE),
reached their peak in the second century CE. These trends were combined in the
third century with Platonism by the Egypto-Roman philosopher, Plotinus (205-
270 CE), to form a religious philosophy known as neoplatonism. Christian
anchorites or hermits of the 3rd century CE, who began the monastic tradition in
Christendom by withdrawing into the Egyptian desert, adopted the mystic goal of
union with God as it was propounded in neoplatonic thought at that time, within a
framework of meditative and ascetic practises of self denial. Although it was “St.”
Pachomius (290-346 CE) who established the first set of rules for Christian
monasticism and founded nine monasteries in the Egyptian desert; “St.” Benedict
of Nursia (480-547 CE), in developing the Benedictine Rule for the monastery at

Monte Cassino in Italy, came to be regarded as the real founder of Western
monastic order.^26 The mystic tradition kept alive in monastic Christianity began to
find expression among Muslims from about 8th century CE, a century after the
borders of the Islamic state had expanded to include Egypt and Syria and its major
centers of monasticism.^27 A group of Muslims who were not satisfied with what
the Sharee _‘_ ah (Islamic Law) had to offer, developed a parallel system which they
named the Tareeqah (the way). Just as the ultimate goal of the Hindu was unity
with the world soul and of the Christian mystic union with God; the ultimate goal
of this movement became Fanaa, the dissolution of the ego, and Wusool, the
meeting and unification of the human soul with Allaah in this life. A series of
preliminary stages and state which had to be attained were defined. They were
called Maqaamaat (stations) and Haalaat (states). A system of spiritual exercises
was also designed for the initiate in order to bring about this “meeting.” These
exercises of Dhikr^28 often involved head and body movements and sometimes
even dance, as in the case of whirling dervishes. All of these practises were
attributed to the Prophet (r) through chains of narration in order to validate them,
but there does not exist any authentic support for them in any of the classical
books of Hadeeth. A multiplicity of systems evolved, and orders, similar to those
among Christian monks, appeared named after their founders, like the Qaadiri,
Chishti, Nakhshabandi, and Teejaani orders. Along with that, volumes of legends
and fairy tales were spun around the founders and the outstanding personalities of
these orders. And, just as Christian and Hind monks chose special isolated
structures (i.e. monasteries) in which to house their communities, the Sufi orders
developed similar housing schemes called Zaawiyahs (lit. corners).

In time , a body of heretic creeds developed out of the mystic “union-with-God”
belief. For example, most orders claimed that Allaah could be seen when the state
of Wusool (arrival) was achieved. Yet when ‘Aa’eshah asked the Prophet (r) if he

(^27) “The authors of treatises on Muslims mysticism have often compared the “annihilation” of
Sufism with Buddhist Nirvana; but according to others this comparison is entirely inadequate as
the Buddhist idea of annihilation is independent of the idea of God and includes the idea of
transmigration of souls, to which Nirvana putsan end. In Muslim mysticism on the other hand,
there is no question of the passing of soul upon death into another body and the notion of a
personal and all-present God is throughout predominant. The origin of the Muslim conception of
Fanaa has rather to be sought in Christianity from which it seems to be borrowed. This conception
simply means the annihilation of the individual human will before the will of God, an idea which
forms the center of all Christian mysticism.” (Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam, p.98).

saw Allaah during Mi _‘_ raaj (ascension) he replied that he had not.^29 Prophet
Moosaa (r) was also shown that neither he nor any man could withstand seeing
Allaah in this life by Allaah revealing some of His being to a mountain which
crumbled to dust during the revelation.^30 Some Sufi adepts claimed that when the
state of Wusool was attained, the mundane obligations of Sharee _‘_ ah like five
times daily Salaah, were no longer obligatory. Most of them prescribed that
prayers to Allaah could be sent through the Prophet (r) or through the co-called
saints; many also began the practice of making Tawaaf,^31 animal sacrifices and
other acts of worship around the shrines and tombs of the saints. Tawaaf can be
observed today around the grave of Zaynab and Sayyid al-Badawi in Egypt,
around the tomb of Muhammad Ahmad (The Mahdi) in Sudan, and around the
Darghas of countless saints and holy men in India and Pakistan.

The Sharee _‘_ ah came to be looked at as the outer path designed for the
ignorant masses, while the Tareeqah was the inner path of an elite enlightened
few. Opinionated Tafseer (Qur’anic commentary) appeared in which the
meanings of the Qur’anic verses were bent and twisted to support the heretical
ideas of the mystic movement. Greek philosophical thought was also blended with
fabricated Hadeeths to produce a body of inauthentic literature which challenged
the early Islamic classics and eventually displaced them among the masses.
Muslim was introduced in most circles and drugs like marijuana could be found in
others as a means of heightening the pseudo-spiritual experience which they all
sought. Such was the legacy of the latter generation of Sufis which had been built
on the false premise that union of the human soul with Allaah was attainable.. The
early generation of pious individuals, like ‘Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaani, and others to
whom some orders were attributed, clearly understood the importance of
distinguishing between the Creator and the created. The two could never become
one, as One was Divine and Eternal, while the other was human and finite.

The Union of God With Man

Nothing escapes Allaah’s knowledge, therefore, the wise are those who act
accordingly. They feel His presence at all times. They carefully perform all their
obligatory (Fard) duties, then they piously try to make up for any of the inevitable
deficiencies by doing a host of voluntary acts. These voluntary acts help to protect
the obligatory duties. For example, during times of weakness or spiritual lows,
one may become lax in fulfilling one’s religious duties. However, those who had

p.113, no.341.

(^31) Walking around an object of religious devotion.


voluntary practises would likely neglect some of their voluntary practises, while
keeping their obligatory duties intact. If they did not have a protective shield of
voluntary acts and they fell into a period of spiritual laziness, some of their
obligatory duties are likely to be discarded or neglected. The more someone
strengthens his obligatory practices by performing voluntary acts, the more his
life conforms to the Sharee _’_ ah, the will of Almighty Allaah. Allaah conveyed this
principle through the Prophet (r) in a Hadeeth saying: _“_ The most beloved thing
with which My slave may come close to me is that which I have made obligatory
(Fard) on him. My servant will continue to come closer to me by voluntary acts
(of worship) until I love him. If I love him, I will be his hearing by which he hears,
his sight by which he sees, his hand by which he grasps, and his foot by which he
walks. If he asks Me anything I would give it and if he seeks refuge in Me I would
protect him. _”_^32

This Walee of Allaah would only hear, see, grasp and walk to what is Halaal
(lawful), while conspicuously avoiding all the Haraam (prohibited) as well as that
which leads towards it. This is the only true goal worthy of dedicating one’s life.
its attainment is the perfection of man’s dual role as servant of God and governor
of the world. But, it cannot be reached except by the route prescribed in the
Hadeeths. First the compulsory duties have to be completely established, then the
prescribed voluntary acts of worship have to be performed consistently and
according to the Sunnah. Allaah emphasized this fact by telling His Prophet to
inform the believers:

###### اللَّ ه يحبِبكﹸم فﹶاتبِعونِي اللَّ ه تحِبونﹶ كﹸنتم إِنﹾ قﹸلﹾ

```
“ Say, if you love Allaah, follow Me (Muhammad) and Allaah will
love you. ”^33
```
Therefore Allaah’s love can only be attained by strictly following the directives
(Sunnah) of His Apostle (r) and by carefully avoiding all innovations in religious
matters. This formula is contained in the following Hadeeth in which the Prophet
(r) was reported by Abu Najeeh to have said, _“_ Keep to my Sunnah and that of the
rightly guided caliphs. Bite on to it with your molars. And beware of innovations,
for verily they are all heresy (Bid **_‘_** ah) and heresy is misguidance which leads to
the hell fire. _”_^34

Tirmithee. (Saheeh Sunan Abu Dawud, vol.3, p.871, no.3851).


One who strictly follows this principle will only listen to what Allaah wishes for
him to listen to. For Allaah said describing the righteous:

###### سلﹶاما قﹶالﹸوا الﹾجاهِلﹸونﹶ خاطﹶبهم وإِذﹶا

```
“ And when the ignorant (mockingly) address them, they merely say:
‘ Peace. ”^35
```
Elsewhere in the Qur’aan He also said,

**فﹶلﹶا بِها ويستهزأﹸ ابِه يكﹾفﹶر اللَّ هِ آياتِ سمِعتم إِذﹶا أﹶنﹾ الﹾكِتابِ فِي علﹶيكﹸم نزلﹶ وقﹶد**

```
“ He has already revealed to you in the Book, that when you hear the
signs of Allaah denied and ridiculed, you should not sit with them
unless they change the subject. If you did you would be like them. ”^36
```
By him listening only to what Allaah wishes for him to hear, Allaah has
metaphorically become his hearing. In a similar way, Allaah becomes his sight,
hands and feet.

This is the correct interpretation of the previously mentioned Hadeeth in which
Allaah states that He will become man’s hearing, sight, hands and feet.
Unfortunately, this Hadeeth has been misinterpreted by mystics as support for the
concept of union with Allaah - May Allaah forbid.

Roohullaah: The **“** Spirit **”** of Allaah

Support for the mystic belief in the re-unification of the human soul with Allaah
has also been falsely deduced from some of the verses of the Qur’aan itself. The
following verses in which Allaah said:

###### روحِهِ مِن فِيهِ نفﹶخو سواه ثﹸم

```
“ Then He (Allaah) fashioned him (Aadam) and blew in him from His

and

###### روحِي مِن فِيهِ ونفﹶخت سويته ِذﹶاإفﹶ

```
“ When I fashioned him and blew into him of My Spirit. ”^38
```
have been used as evidence for the belief that every human being contains within
his body a part of God. The portion of Allaah’s “spirit” which Allaah breathed
into Aadam has supposedly been inherited by all of his descendents. Reference
has also been made to Prophet ‘Eesaa about whose mother Allaah said,

###### لِلﹾعالﹶمِين ﹰةآي وابنها وجعلﹾناها روحِنا مِن فِيها فﹶنفﹶخنا فﹶرجها أﹶحصنت والَّ تِي

```
“ She was chaste, so We blew into her from Our Spirit... ”^39
```
Thus, it is believed among mystics that this divine eternal spirit within man yearns
to reunite with its origin from whence it came. However, this is not the case.
Possessive pronouns (my, your, his, her, our) in Arabic, as in English, have to
general meanings depending on the context in which they are used. They may
describe an attribute or a possession which is or is not a part of its owner. For
example, in Allaah’s command to Prophet Moosaa (Moses)

###### سوءٍ غﹶيرِ مِن اءَضبي جتخر جناحِك إِلﹶى كيد واضمم

```
“ Put your hand inside your shirt and it will come out shining
unharmed... ”^40
```
both the “hand” and “shirt” belonged to Prophet Moosaa but his hand was an
attribute which was a part of him, while his shirt was a possession which was not
a part of him. The same is the case relative to God with regards to His attributes
and His creation.^41 For example, in the case of divine mercy wherein He says:

###### ُيشاء من بِرحمتِهِ صيخت واللَّ ه

```
“ Allaah give His mercy specifically to whomsoever He wishes... ”^42
```
Allaah’s mercy is one of his attributes and not a part of His creation. On the other
hand, Allaah sometimes refers to created things as “His” to emphasize the fact
that He created them. Yet others are referred to as His to indicate the special
position of honor with which He views them. For example, with respect to the

She-Camel sent as a test to Prophet Saalih’s people, the Thamood, Allaah quoted
Prophet Saalih as saying,

###### اللَّ هِ ِضأﹶر فِي تأﹾكﹸلﹾ فﹶذﹶروها ﹰةآي لﹶكﹸم اللَّ هِ ﹸةناقﹶ هذِهِ

```
“ This is Allaah ’ s camel sent to you as a sign. So allow it to graze in
Allaah ’ s earth. ”^43
```
The camel was miraculously sent as a sign to the Thamood who did not have any
right to deny it from grazing, because the whole earth belongs to Allaah. Similarly
is the case of the Ka’bah about which Allaah made a covenant with Prophets
Ibraaheem (Abraham) and Ismaa‘eel (Ishmael):

###### السجودِ ِعوالركَّ والﹾعاكِفِين ِفِينئلِلطَّ ا بيتِي طﹶهرا أﹶنﹾ

“ That they may purify My house for those who circle it, cling to it,
bow down prostrate (near it). ”^44
```
and paradise in the case of the righteous who on the Day of Judgement will be
told by Allaah **“** Enter My Paradise. **”**^45

As for the spirit (Rooh), it is one of Allaah’s creations. Allaah states in the
Qur’aan

###### قﹶلِيلﹰا إِلَّ ا الﹾعِلﹾمِ مِن أﹸوتِيتم وما ربي أﹶمرِ مِن حالرو قﹸلﹾ ِحالرو عن ويسأﹶلﹸونك

(^47) Soorah Aal ‘Imraan, (3):47.


```
“ He (Allaah) created him (Aadam) from clay then said: Be, and he
was. ”^48
```
The command is “be” for all of creation. Therefore, the spirit is created by
Allaah’s command. Islaam does not consider God to be an incorporeal Spirit, as
do some religions like Christianity. He has neither corporeal body nor is He a
formless spirit. He has a form befitting His majesty, the like of which no man has
ever seen or conceived, and which will only be seen (to the degree of man’s finite
limitations) by the people of paradise.^49 Consequently, when Allaah refers to the
blowing of a spirit from Himself into prophets Aadam and ‘Eesaa, special honor
is given to their created spirits due to the prominence of Prophet Aadam’s
position in relation to the rest of mankind and to clarify the confusion concerning
Maryam’s virgin birth of Prophet ‘Eesaa. Even Allaah’s attribution of the act of
blowing to Himself is, in fact, a clarification of His will and supreme power, for it
is the angels who actually insert and extract the souls into man. This fact is
evident from the following Hadeeth of Ibn Mas‘oud who reported that Allaah’s
Messenger said, _“_ Verily you creation is combined in you mother _’_ s womb for forty
days in the form of an oily fluid, then as a leach-like clot for a similar period and
as a clump of flesh for another similar period. Then an angel is sent to him to
blow the spirit into him... _”_^50

Thus, Allaah has the spirit blown into every human by one of His angels. By
saying that ‘He blew’, Allaah in fact reminds us that He is the primary cause of all
that takes place in creation, as He said:

###### تعملﹸونﹶ وما خلﹶقﹶكﹸم واللَّ ه

```
“ Allaah created you and whatever you do. ”^51
```
Just prior to the battle of Badr the Prophet (r) threw a handful of dust at the
enemy ranks assembled hundreds of yards away, but Allaah caused some of the
dust particles to miraculously reach all of the eyes of the enemy. Allaah referred
to the Prophet’s action as follows:

###### رمى اللَّ ه ولﹶكِن رميت إِذﹾ رميت وما

```
“ It was not you that threw when you threw but it was Allaah who
threw. ”^52
```
(^48) Soorah Aal ‘Imraan, (3):59.
(^49) See the Chapter on Seeing Allaah, p.136 of this work for further detail on this point.
(^50) Collected by al-Bukhaaree (Sahih Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English), vol.4, pp.290-1, no.430) and
Muslim. (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.) vol.4, p.1391, no.6390).
(^51) Soorah as-Saaffaat, (37):96.


Thus, by attributing the Spirit to Himself. Allaah simply gave it a special place of
honour among the spirits which He has created. No that He, Allaah, has a spirit
and blew off a piece of it into both Prophet Aadam and Prophet ‘Eesaa. To further
emphasize that point Allaah also refers to the Angel sent to inform Maryam as
“His spirit”:

###### سوِيا بشرا لﹶها فﹶتمثَّ لﹶ روحنا إِلﹶيها فﹶأﹶرسلﹾنا

```
“ So we sent to her Our Spirit who took the appearance of a well
formed man. ”^53
```
The Qur’aan is a totality. Its verses explain themselves and the sayings and
practices of the Prophet (r) further clarify its meanings. When verses are taken
out of context, the meanings, of the Qur’aan can easily be distorted. For example,
verse four of Soorah al-Maa‘oon reads:

###### ين ِّلِلِمصل ﹲفﹶويل

```
“ Woe be on those who make prayer (Salaah). ”
```
This verse by itself is in total contradiction to the rest of Qur’aan and Islaam.
Salaah has been made obligatory throughout the Qur’aan, For example, Allaah
said:

###### يلِذِكﹾرِ الصلﹶاةﹶ وأﹶقِم فﹶاعبدنِي أﹶنا إِلَّ ا إِلﹶه لﹶا اللَّ ه أﹶنا إِننِي

```
“ Verily I am Allaah, there is no god besides me, so worship me and
establish prayer (Salaah) in order to remember Me. ”^54
```
Yet this verse curses those who make Salaah! However, the verses which follow
it clarify the intended meanings as:

###### الﹾماعونﹶ ويمنعونﹶ * ونﹶُيراء هم الَّ ذِين * ساهونﹶ لﹶاتِهِمص عن هم الَّ ذِين

```
“ Those who are negligent in their Salaah, who do it to be seen. Yet
they refuse even the simplest of kindness. ”^55
```
Thus, Allaah’s curse is on the Salaah of the hypocrites who pretend belief and not
on all who make Salaah.

(^53) Soorah Maryam, (19):17.
(^54) Soorah Taahaa, (20):14.
(^55) Soorah al-Maa‘oon, (107):5-7.


A more meaningful translation of the verse _“_ Then He fashioned him (Aadam)
and blew into him from His spirit, _”_ would be **“** Then He fashioned him and
caused one of His (noble) spirits to enter him. **”** Consequently, there is no basis
is the divine scriptures for the mystic belief in the uncreated soul of man, yearning
to re-unite with its origin, God. In Islaam, there is no distinction between the
Arabic terms Rooh (spirit - pl. Arwaah) and Nafs (soul-pl. Anfus) with respect to
man except that when it is connected to the body it is usually referred to as a
Nafs.^56 In the Qur’aan God states:

###### منامِها فِي تمت لﹶم والَّ تِي موتِها حِين سالﹾأﹶنفﹸ يتوفَّ ى اللَّ ه

```
“ It is Allaah who takes the souls (Anfus) at death and those which do
not die (He takes) during their sleep... ”^57
```
The Prophet (r) was reported by Umm Salamah to have said, _“_ Verily,
when the spirit (Rooh) is taken the eyes follow it. _”_^58

The successful souls will be made to enter paradise as Allaah said to the righteous
souls

Thus, in the end, the righteous human soul will not become extinguished in God
nor unite with His supreme being, but will remain a finite spirit reunited with a
finite body enjoying the pleasures of paradise for as long as Allaah wishes.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF GRAVE WORSHIP

Throughout much of human history, honoring the dead through elaborate burial
rites, ornate tombs and decorated graves, along with festivals of commemoration
and adoration has led to great confusion and misguidance in religion. As a result,
much of mankind has become involved in some form of grave worship. In fact,
the religion of most Chinese, who represent between a quarter and a third of
mankind, is ancestor worship. Most of their religious rites are connected with
graves and the worship of representations of their ancestors.^60 The graves of holy
or saintly men among Hindus, Buddhists and Christians, have become shrines
where rites of worship like prayer, sacrifice and pilgrimage are performed on a
large scale. With the passage of time, Muslim rulers and the masses strayed away
from the fundamental principles of the Islamic creed and began to imitate the
pagan practices of the non-Islamic nations around them. Huge edifices were built
over the grave of companions of the Prophet (r) like ‘Alee, major jurists like
Imaam Abu Haneefah and Imaam ash-Shaafi‘ee, and those designated as Sufi
“saints” like Junayd and ‘Abdul-Qaadir Al-Jeelaanee. In more recent times this
practice of building shrines included even the graves of leaders of social
movements like Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and Muhammad
Ahmed, the so-called Mahdi of the Sudan. Today many ignorant Muslims travel
vast distances in order to perform religious rites of tawaaf around these tombs.
Some even make prayer inside and outside of them, and other ‘piously’ bring
sacrificial animals to these cursed sites in order to perform the rites of dhabh
(ritual sacrifice) there. Most of those who perform rites of worship at
graves hold the false belief that the righteous among these dead people are so
close to Allaah that all acts of worship done in their vicinity will more likely be
accepted by Allaah than if they were done elsewhere. That is, since these dead
individuals were blessed, all that is near them must also be blessed. Their tombs
and even the land on which they are built must be permeated with the overflow of
their surplus blessing. Because of this belief, grave-worshippers often wipe the
walls of graves, then wipe it on themselves in order to collect extra blessings.
Often they collect the earth in the vicinity of the graves, in the vain belief that the
earth has special healing powers due to the effect of the blessings manifest in

(^60) The veneration of ancestors (Pai Tsu) is one of the most ancient, persistent, and influential
themes in Chinese religion and traditional Chinese society. According to their beliefs, the Hun
(spiritual soul) and the P _’_ o (gross soul) of the dead are dependent for their survival and happiness
upon the offerings of spirit money, incense, food and drink made by their descendants. In return,
the Hun, as a spirit (Shen), can achieve considerable benefits for the family by means of its
supernatural contacts. In the case of ordinary beings this relationship is only considered to last for
three to five generations. The souls are then succeeded by more recent ones. (Dictionary of
Religions, p.38).


those buried there. Many among certain branches of the Shi _‘_ ites collect clay from
Karbala, where Imaam Hussain was martyred, and bake them to make small
tablets on which they prostrate during their salaah (prayer).

Prayers to the Dead

Those who practice grave worship direct prayers to the dead in two ways:

1. Some use the dead as intercessors. They pray to them in the way that Catholics
use their priests in the confession of their sins. Catholics confess their sins to their
priests and the priests ask God’s forgiveness for them. Thus, the priests act as
middle-men between the people and God.

The pre-Islamic Arabs viewed their idols in a similar way. Allaah quoted the
pagan Arabs as saying,

###### لﹾفﹶىز اللَّ هِ إِلﹶى لِيقﹶربونا إِلَّ ا نعبدهم ما

```
“ We only worship them so that they may bring us closer to
Allaah. ”^61
```
Some grave worshippers among Muslims pray to the dead asking them to convey
their requests to Allaah for the fulfillment of their needs. This practice is based on
their belief that righteous dead people are not only closer to Allaah than they are,
but also that they are capable of hearing any man’s request and fulfilling it, even
after their death! Thus, the dead become idol intermediaries capable of doing
favors for the living.

2. Others pray directly to the dead, begging them forgiveness for their sins. In so
doing, they give dead humans Allaah’s attribute of being at-Tawwaab, the one to
whom repentance is due, as well as that of being al-Ghafoor, the only one capable
of forgiving sins. There is a strong similarity between their practice and that of the
Catholics among Christians who call on special saints for the fulfillment of their
daily needs. For example, if something is lost, Saint Anthony of Thebes is prayed
to in order to help find it.^62 St. Jude Thaddaeus is the patron saint of the
impossible and is prayed to for intercession in incurable illnesses, unlikely
marriages, and the like.^63 If someone is setting out on a journey, Saint
Christopher, the patron saint of travelers, used to be prayed to for protection up
until 1969 when he was officially struck off the list of saints by papal decree, after

it was confirmed that he was fictitious.^64 Included in this category are Christians
in general with regard to Prophet Jesus whom they consider to be God incarnate.
Most Christians pray to Jesus instead of God. There are also many ignorant
Muslims throughout the world who direct their prayers to the Prophet Muhammad
(r) in this fashion.

Both of methods of grave worship are totally rejected by the teachings of
Islaam, which hold that one who dies enters the dimension called the Barzakh,
where his deeds come to an end. He is unable to do anything for the living, though
the results of his deeds may affect the living and continue to earn reward or
punishment for himself. Abu Hurayrah reported Allaah’s Messenger as saying,
_“_ When a man dies, his (good) deeds come to an end, except in three ways: charity
of continuing benefit, knowledge beneficial to people, and a righteous child who
prays for him. _”_^65 The Prophet (r) also took great pains to explain that he could
not benefit anyone in this life, regardless of their closeness to him. Allaah
commanded him in the Qur’aan to say to his followers:

**لﹶاستكﹾثﹶرت بيغالﹾ أﹶعلﹶم كﹸنت ولﹶو اللَّ ه اءَش ما إِلَّ ا ضرا ولﹶا نفﹾعا لِنفﹾسِي أﹶملِك لﹶا قﹸلﹾ**

would surely have accumulated only good and no evil would have
befallen me. But I am only a warner and a bringer of glad tidings for
those who believe. ”^66
```
One of his companions, Abu Hurayrah, reported that when the verse

###### الﹾأﹶقﹾربِين تكيرعشِ وأﹶنذِر

“ Warn your nearest kin ”^67
```
was revealed to the Prophet, he said, _“_ O people of Quraysh, secure deliverance
from Allaah (by doing good deeds). I cannot avail you at all against Allaah, O
sons of _‘_ Abdul-Muttalib, I cannot avail you at all against Allaah, O (my uncle)
_‘_ Abbaas ibn _‘_ Abdul-Muttalib, O (my aunt) Safeeyah, I cannot avail you at all

against Allaah, O Faatimah, daughter of Muhammad, ask me whatever you like,
but I have nothing which can avail you against Allaah! _”_^68

On another occasion, one of the Prophet’s companions concluded his
statement to the Prophet (r) with the phrase, “It is what Allaah wills, and what
you will.” The Prophet (r) immediately corrected him, saying, _“_ Are you making
me an equal to Allaah? Say: _‘_ It is what Allaah alone wills. _’”_^69

In spite of this clear indication that the Prophet (r), has no power to
change what Allaah has destined many Muslims not only pray to him for help, but
also pray to a hierarchy of saints. This heretical practice is based on the claim or
mystics (Sufis) that the cosmic order is preserved by a fixed number of saints
called Rijaal al-Ghayb (the men of the unseen world). When a holy man among
them dies, his place is immediately filled by a substitute. At the peak of the
hierarchy is the Qutb (people or mystic axis of the world), or the Ghawth
(succour). ‘Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee (d. 1166 C.E.) is popularly referred to as
al-Ghawth al-A _‘_ dham (Ghaus-e-Azam) “the greatest source of help,” and in times
of calamity many turn to him for help, crying out, Yaa _‘_ Abdal-Qaadir, aghithnee!
(O ‘Abdul Qaadir, save me!) Such unmistakable pronouncements of shirk are
common even though practicing Muslims repeat in each of their daily prayers the
phrase, Eeyaaka na **_‘_** budu wa eeyaaka nasta **_‘_** een (You alone do we worship
and from You alone do we seek help).

Both using the dead as intercessors and praying to them directly contain the
grave sin of shirk, which Islaam vigilantly opposes, yet both methods have
managed to creep into the religious practices of the masses of Muslims today in
one form or another. In so doing they inadvertently confirm the veracity of
Allaah’s ominous statement in the Qur’aan,

“ Most of them (claim) belief in Allaah, while committing shirk. ”^70
```
They also confirm the Prophet’s warning, reported by Abu Sa’eed al-Khudree:
_“_ You will follow the practices of your predecessors, inch by inch and yard by
yard; so much so that if they were to enter a lizard _’_ s hole, you would also follow

them. _”_ When he was asked if he meant the Jews the Christians, he replied _“_ If not
them, who else? _”_^71

This prophecy not only refers to the present varieties of grave worship
among Muslims, but also forebodes the imitation of christian idolatory, as in the
catholic veneration of icons. Thawbaan reported that the Prophet (r) said, _“_ The
Last Hour will not come until some groups of my nation worship idols, _”_^72 and
Abu Hurayrah reported that he said, _“_ The Last Hour will not come until women
from the Daws tribe wiggle their buttocks (as they circumambulate) around the
temple of the idol^73 al-Khalasah. _”_

In light of the above warnings it is, essential that Muslims have a clear
understanding of religion, its origin and its historical development once this is
achieved practices such as those we have discussed may be comprehended in their
proper context, and the Islamic ruling on them will become obvious. In the
following pages then, we shall analyze the development of religion with a view to
understanding the origins of grave and idol-worship.

Restrictions on Visiting Graves

The fact that grave-worship was among the last things which the Prophet
(r) warned against before leaving the world indicates that this practice would
become a serious test for his ummah. In the formative years of Islaam, the Prophet
(r) had forbidden his followers from even visiting graves, and it was not until
tawheed (belief in God’s unity) was firmly established among them that the ban
was lifted. The Prophet (r) was reported to have said, _“_ I used to forbid you from
visiting graves, but now you should visit them, for surely they are reminders of the
next life. _”_^74

However, in spite of this allowance, the Prophet (r) placed certain restrictions on
the visiting of graves in order to avoid its deterioration into grave worship in later
generations:

1. As a means of setting up a barrier against grave worship, prayer was totally
    forbidden in graveyards regardless of the intention. Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudree
    reported from the Prophet (r) that he said: _“_ All the earth is a masjid (place of
    worship) except graveyards and toilets. _”_^75 Ibn ‘Umar also reported that the
    Prophet (r) said, _“_ Pray in your houses; do not make them graveyards. _”_^76
    Voluntary prayer is recommended in the home as an example for the family. If
    no prayer takes place there, it then resembles a graveyard in which no prayer
    is allowed. Although praying to Allaah in a graveyard is not in itself shirk, the
    ignorant, under Satan’s influence, may assume that prayers in graveyards are
    to the dead and not for them. Consequently, this avenue to idolatry was
    decisively blocked On one occasions the second Caliph, ‘Umar ibn al-
    Khattaab, noticed another of the Prophet’s companions, Anas ibn Maalik,
    praying near a grave and called out to him, “The grave! The grave!”^77
2. A second barrier was placed by the Prophet’s (r) prohibition of purposely
    praying in the direction of graves because such an act may be later understood
    by the ignorant as prayer directed to the dead themselves. Abu Marthad al-
    Ghanawee reported that the Prophet said, _“_ Do not pray towards graves not sit
    on them. _”_^78

(^77) Collected by al-Bukhaaree (Sahih Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English), vol.1, p.251, no.48). These
Hadeeths also confirm that the Prophet’s prohibition of prayer in graveyards was not due to the
area being considered ritually impure (Najis). The graves of the prophets are pure, because,
according to the Prophet (r), Allaah has not allowed the earth to eat their bodies. Hence, the
Prophet’s curse on the Jews and Christians for taking the graves of their prophets as places of
worship was due to the Shirk involved and not the impurity of the area. (Tayseer al- _‘_ Azeez al-
Hameed, p.328).

(Sunan Abu Dawud, (English Trans.), vol.2, p.917, no.3223), an-Naasaa’ee and Ibn Maajah. This
includes even Du _‘_ aa (informal prayer) in their direction, because the Prophet (r) had said that
Du **_‘_** aa is worship (Collected by al-Bukhaaree in al-Adab al-Mufrad), Abu Daawood (Sunan Abu
Dawud, (English Trans.), vol.1, p.387, no.1474), at-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah. Du _‘_ aa should be
made in the same direction as Salaah (Formal prayer, towards the Qiblah (Makkah).
Note:
It should also be noted that in Islam the funeral service is not held in the graveyard, but in a prayer
area set aside for large congregational prayers or in a masjid. Furthermore, because the body is
placed at the front of the congregation, directly in front of the Imaam (prayer leader), the funeral
prayer (Salaatul-Janaazah) does not have any bowing (Rukoo _‘_ ) or prostration (Sujood), so as not
to give anyone the impression that the prayer is to the dead and not merely for the dead as the
wordings of the prayer clearly indicate.


3. The recitation of Qur’aan in graveyards is not allowed, as neither the Prophet
    (r) nor his companions were known to do so. When the Prophet’s wife,
    ‘Aa’eshah, asked him what to say when visiting graveyards, he told her to
    give salaams (greetings of peace) and a supplication for those buried but did
    not tell her to recite al-Faatihah or any other chapter from the Qur’aan.^79 Abu
    Hurayrah further reported that the Prophet (r) had said, _“_ Do not make your
    houses graveyards, for verily Satan flees from the house in which Soorah al-
    Baqarah is read. _”_^80 This narration and others like it imply that the Qur’aan is
    not to be read in graveyards. Qur’anic recitation is encouraged in one’s house,
    and making it like a graveyard, in which no recitation should take place, is
    forbidden.^81
4. The Prophet (r) forbade the white-washing of graves, the building of
    structures over them,^82 writing on them,^83 or raising them above ground
    level.^84 He also taught that any such structures should be torn down and the
    graves made level with the ground. ‘Alee ibn Abee Taalib reported that the
    Prophet (r) ordered him to demolish all idols he came across, and to level all
    graves more than a palm **’** s width high to the height of the surrounding earth.^85

5. The building of masjids over graves was expressly forbidden by the Prophet
    (r). The Prophet’s wife ‘Aa’eshah, reported that when death was descending
    upon Allaah’s Messenger, he drew his striped cloak over his face saying,
    _“_ May Allaah _’_ s curse be on the Jews and Christians for taking the graves of
    their prophets as places of worship. _”_^86
6. In order to prevent grave worship, the Prophet (r) also forbade annual or
    seasonal gatherings even around his own grave. Abu Hurayrah reported that
    he said, _“_ Do not make my grave an _‘_ eed (place of celebration), nor make your
    houses graveyards, and ask (Allaah _’_ s) blessings for me wherever you may be,
    for they will reach me. _”_^87
7. Setting out on journeys to visit graves was also forbidden by the Prophet (r).
    This practice forms the basis of idolatrous pilgrimages in other religions. Abu
    Hurayrah and Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudree both reported that Allaah’s Messenger
    said, _“_ Do not travel except to three masjids, Masjid Haraam (the Ka _‘_ bah in
    Makkah), the masjid of the Messenger, and all Aqsaa Masjid. _”_^88 While
    returning from a trip Abu Bashrah al-Ghifaaree met Abu Hurayrah and the
    latter asked him where he was coming from. Abu Bashra replied that he was

Abee Taalib said to him, _“_ Shaal I send you as the messenger of Allaah sent me? To deface every
statue or picture in houses and level all elevated graves. _”_
Note
These Hadeeths have been forgotten in many Muslim lands where graveyards have become filled
with a variety of structures built over graves in imitation of other nations. In some lands like
Egypt, graveyards resemble towns with well defined streets. Tombs to house the dead resemble
houses, so much so that in some places poor families have broken into them and set up permanent
residence in them. Based on this Hadeeth and others like it, not only should such tombs be
demolished, but also mausoleums like the Taj Mahal in India, the one erected over the grave of the
founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in Karachi, Pakistan, the tomb of the claimed Mahdi
in Sudan that of Sayyid al-Badawee in Egypt, etc. Such a step would also cancel the role of the
Sadanah (custodians) of the shrines who live off the generous donations of visitors who believe
that generosity to the custodians can facilitate prayers to saints and guarantee results.

graves of so-called saints, are completely outside the teachings of Islaam. Not only should the
shrines be demolished, as indicated by the Prophet’s command narrated by the fourth Righteous
Caliph, ‘Alee, but these religious festivals should also be stopped.

“Taking Graves as Places of Worship”:

Ibn Mas‘oud reported that the Prophet (r) said, _“_ The most evil of mankind are
those who will be alive when the Last Day arrives and those who take graves as
places of worship. _”_^90 Jundub ibn ‘Abdillaah reported that five days before the
Prophet’s death he heard him say, _“_ Those before you took the graves of their
prophets as places of worship. Do not take graves as places of worship for verily I
forbid you to do so. _”_^91 After understanding clearly from the previous Hadeeths
that taking graves as places of worship is forbidden by the Prophet (r), it is
necessary to define exactly what is meant by the phrase _“_ Taking graves as places
of worship. _”_ There are three possible meanings which can be deduced from the
phrase in Arabic:

1. Making Prayer or Sujood (prostration) on or Towards a Grave. Praying on
    the grave is forbidden explicitly in Ibn ‘Abbaas’ Hadeeth in which the Prophet
    (r) said, _“_ Do not pray towards graves nor on them _”_^92 as well as the Hadeeth
    narrated by Abu Marthad mentioned earlier.
2. Building a Masjid over a Grave or Putting a Grave in a Masjid. Building
    masjids over graves is forbidden by Umm Salamah’s hadeeth in which the
    Prophet (r) explained that those who build places of worship over graves are
    the most evil of creation in Allaah’s sight. Placing a grave in a masjid was
    also forbidden according to ‘Aa’eshah interpretation of the Prophet’s final
    statement, _“_ May Allaah curse a people who take their Prophets _’_ (r) graves as
    masjids. _”_^93 When the suggestion was made to bury the Prophet (r) in his
    masjid, she opposed it based on the Prophet’s (r) last words.

what is at the end of the path. For example, the Prophet (r) forbade wind and
stringed musical instruments (ma ‘ aazif). Abu Maalik al-Ash‘aree reported that
he heard the Prophet (r) say, “ There will be among my followers those who
make allowable (halaal) fornication and adultery, the wearing of silk (for
men), taking intoxicants, and musical instruments (ma ‘ aazif). ”^94 Both the
playing of these instruments and listening to music are automatically
prohibited as they are the purposes for which musical instruments are made.
Similarly, neither the prohibition on building masjids over graves not the
order to build them elsewhere is aimed at the act of construction, for building
is in itself permissible. It is, in fact, aimed at the performance of salaah in
them, which is the purpose for which they are built. Thus, the prohibition of
building masjids on graves automatically implies the prohibition on salaah in
such masjids.
```
Masjids with Graves

Such masjids are of two types with regard to their origin-

a. masjid built over a grave, and

b. masjid in which a grave has been put, some time after its construction.

Naturally, there is no difference between the two as far as salaah is concerned. In
both cases, salaah in them is despised if no regard is paid to the grave, and
haraam if salaah to the grave is intended. However, the method of correcting
such masjids varies according to their origin:

1. A masjid built over a grave should be demolished and the grave levelled if it
    has a structure over it. Because such a masjid was originally a grave, it should
    be returned to its original state.
2. A masjid in which a grave has been placed should be left intact, but the grave
    should be removed. In this case the masjid was originally a masjid and not a
    grave; thus, it should be returned to its original states.

The Prophet’s Grave

The presence of the Prophet’s grave in his masjid in Madeenah can neither be
used to justify the placing of bodies in other masjids nor the building of masjids
over graves. The Prophet (r) did not order that he be buried in his masjid, nor did
his companions put his grave into the masjid. The companions of the Prophet (r)

(^94) Collected by al-Bukhaaree (Sahih al-Bukhari, (Arabic-English), vol.7, p.345, no.484 [B]).


wisely avoided burying the Prophet (r) in the local graveyard for fear that later
generations would become overly attached to his grave. ‘Umar, the freed slave of
Ghafrah, related that when the sahaabah (companions of the Prophet (r) gathered
to decide on the Prophet’s (r) burial, one said: “Let us bury him in the place where
he used to pray.” Abu Bakr replied, “May Allaah protect us from making him an
idol to be worshipped.” Others said, “Let us bury him in al-Baqee’ (a graveyard in
Madeenah) where his brothers among the Muhaajireen (migrants from Makkah)
are buried.” Abu Bakr replied: “Verily burying the Prophet in al-Baqee‘ is
detestable because some people may try to seek refuge in him which is a right
belonging only to Allaah. So, if we take him out (to the graveyard), we will ruin
Allaah’s right, even if we carefully guard the Messenger’s grave.” They then
asked, “What is your opinion, O Abu Bakr?” He replied, “I heard Allaah’s
Messenger say: _‘_ Allaah has not taken the life of any of his prophets except that
were buried where they died. _”_ Some of them said, “By Allaah, what you have
said is pleasing and convincing.” Then they made a line around the Prophet’s bed
(in ‘Aa’eshah’s house) and dug the grave where his bed was. ‘Alee, al-‘Abbaas,
al-Fadl, and the Prophet’s family took his body and prepared it for burial.^95

‘Aa’eshah’s house was separated from the masjid by a wall and it had a door
through which the Prophet (r) used to enter the masjid to lead salaah. The
companions sealed off this doorway in order to complete the separation of the
Prophet’s grave from his masjid. Consequently, the only way that his grave could
be visited at that time was from outside the masjid.

Expansions of the masjid took place in the time of the second Caliph ‘Umar and
the third Caliph ‘Uthmaan. But both of them cautiously avoided the inclusion of
either ‘Aa’eshah’s house or that of any of the other wives of the Prophet (r).
Expansion in the direction of the houses of the wives of the Prophet (r) would
have automatically included the Prophet’s grave in the masjid. However, after the
death of all the sahaabah who were in Medinah,^96 Caliph al-Waleed ibn ‘Abdil-
Malik (reign 705-715 C.E.) was the first to extend the masjid in an easterly
direction. He included ‘Aa’eshah’s house inside the masjid, but demolished the
houses of the other wives of the Prophet (r). The expansion was reported to have
been carried out by al-Waleed’s governor ‘Umar ibn ‘Abdul-‘Azeez.

When ‘Aa’eshah’s house was included inside the masjid, a high circular wall was
built around it so that it would not be visible at all from inside the masjid. Two
additional walls were later built at an angle from the two northern corners of the

house in such a way that they met each other forming a triangle. This was down to
prevent anyone from facing the grave directly.^97

Many years later, the familiar dome was added to the roof of the masjid and was
placed directly above the Prophet’s (r) grave.^98 The grave was later surrounded by
a brass cage with doors and windows, and the walls of the grave itself were
draped in green cloth. In spite of the barriers which have been placed around the
Prophet’s grave, the error still remains to be corrected. Walls should once again
be placed to separate it from the masjid so that no one could pray in its direction
nor visit it inside the masjid.

_Salaah_ in the Prophet’s Masjid

The prohibition of salaah in masjids with graves in them is applicable to all
masjids except that of the Prophet (r). This is due to the many special virtues
attributed to prayer in it, not found in any other masjid containing a grave.^99 The
Prophet (r) himself pointed out this special feature saying, _“_ Do not journey
except to three masjids: al-Masjid al-Haraam, al-masjid al-Aqsaa, and this
Masjid of mine. _”_^100 He also said: _“_ A single salaah in this masjid of mine, is better
than 1,000 salaahs elsewhere, except al-Masjid al-Haraam. _”_^101 He even assigned
special significance to a part of his masjid saying: _“_ The area between my house
and my pulpit is a garden from the gardens of paradise. _”_^102 If salaah in the
Prophet’s masjid was considered makrooh (disliked), the virtues of his masjid
would be negated and it would be made equal with all other masjids. Just as
salaah in general has been forbidden at certain times, yet allowed if it has a
defined purpose (e.g., janaazah) other than optional prayer, salaah in the
Prophet’s masjid is likewise desirable due to its exceptional nature.^103 And,
Allaah forbid, if a grave were to be put in either al-Masjid al-Haraam or al-Masjid

1.4 TRANSCENDENCE
```
Allaah, Most Great and Glorious, has described Himself in His revealed books
and through His prophets in order that man may have a better understanding of
just who He is. Since the human mind is limited in its knowledge and scope, it is
impossible for it to understand something which has no limits. Therefore, Allaah
mercifully took it upon Himself to reveal to man some of His attribute, in order
that mankind may not confuse the attributes of created things with those of
Allaah. When Allaah’s attributes are confused with those of creation, man ends up
deifying creation. It is this deification of creation which is the essence and basis
of idolatry in all of its forms. In all pagan religions and cults created beings or
objects are falsely endowed by man with divine attributes and consequently they
become objects of worship instead of Allaah or along with Allaah.

Among Allaah’s countless attributes is one which is of paramount
importance with regard to the worship of God as opposed to the worship of His
creation. It is an attribute which became confused with the appearance among
Muslims of the Greek-influenced Mu _‘_ tazilite school of philosophical thought and
remains misunderstood among many Muslims until today.^1 This critical attributes
is that of _“_ al- _‘_ Uloo _”_ , which in English means highness or transcendence. When it
is used to describe Allaah, this attribute refers to the fact that Allaah is above and
beyond His creation. He is neither enclosed by the creation nor is any part of the
creation above Him in any way. He is not a part of the created world nor is it a
part of Him. In fact, His Being is totally distinct and separate from His creation.
He is the Creator and the universe and its contents are all a part of His creation.
However, His attributes function without restriction in His creation. He sees,
hears and knows all, and He is the prime cause of all the happens within the
worlds of creation. Nothing happens without His will. Consequently, it may be
said that the Islamic concept of Allaah in relationship to His creation is essentially
dualistic, but in relationship to Allaah alone or creation alone it is strictly
unitarian. It is dualistic in the sense that Allaah is Allaah, and creation is creation.
Two separate entities, the Creator and the created, the Infinite and the finite.
Neither is one the other nor are they both one. At the same time the Islamic
concept is uncompromisingly unitarian in the sense that Allaah is absolutely one,
without parents, offspring or partner. He is unique in His divinity and nothing is
similar to Him. He is the sole source of power in the universe and everything

(^1) Nassiruddeen al-Albaanee, Mukhtasar al- _‘_ Uloo, (Beirut: al-Maktab al-Islaamee, 1st ed., 1981),
233.


depends on Him. Likewise, it is firmly unitarian vis-a-vis creation, because all of
the universe and its contents were created by Allaah alone. All created beings and
entities are the product of the same Creator, and, as such, are constructed from the
same elemental substances, the building blocks of “nature”

Significance:

The attribute of transcendence has special significance to man with regard
to his worship of God. Prior to the arrival of Islaam in its final form, man had
strayed far away from the implications of this noble attribute. Christians claimed
that Allaah had come to the earth and became flesh and blood in the form of man,
Prophet ‘Eesaa (Jesus), whom they claim was crucified and died. The Jews before
them also claimed that Allaah came down to earth in the form of a man and lost in
a wrestling match with Prophet Yaqoob (Jacob).^2 The Persians regarded their
kings as gods endowed with all of Allaah’s attributes, and, consequently, they
worshipped them directly. The Hindus believed that Brahman, the supreme
Being, was in every place and in everything so they worshipped countless idols,
human beings and even animals as personifications of Brahman.^3 In fact, this
belief has taken Hindus to an incredible state wherein they actually make
pilgrimage to their Holy city of Banaras to worship the god Shiva personified as
an erect male penis end earingly called _“_ lingam. _”_^4

The Hindu idea that Brahman is everywhere later became a part of the
Christian belief system and eventually found its way among the Muslims many
generations after the Prophet (r). When the philosophical books of India, Persia
and Greece were translated during the Golden Age of the ‘Abbaasid Empire, the
concept of Allaah being everywhere and in every thing was introduced into
philosophical circles and became a foundational principle in the creed of Sufi
(mystical) orders. Eventually it gained sway with a philosophical school known as
the Mu _‘_ tazilah (the Rationalists) followers of which occupied key posts in the
administration of the ‘Abbaasid Caliph, Ma’moon (rule: 813 to 832 CE). With the

creates. Lingams, usually shaped from stone, are phallic symbols representing the god’s
regenerative powers. Huge Lingams are a common feature of temples. The Lingam typically
appears on a circular base, called a Yoni (female organ), that represents Shakti, the god’s female
half and a source of divine energy. In the broadest sense, the Lingam symbolizes the entirety of
the Hindu universe... In a common Hindu ceremony, a priest bedecks a Lingam with flowers,
anoints it with clarified butter, and washes it with milk and water!”


blessing of the Caliph, they vigorously propagated this belief along with the other
distortions contained in their school of philosophy. Inquisition courts were set up
throughout the empire and many scholars were killed, jailed and tortured for their
opposition to the philosophy of the Mu _‘_ tazilites.

It was not until Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (778-855 CE) stood his ground
and defended the beliefs of early Muslim scholars and the Sahaabah,
(companions of the Prophet), that the tide was eventually turned. During the reign
of Caliph al-Mutawakkil (rule 847-861), the Mu _‘_ tazilite philosophers were
removed from sensitive administrative posts in the government and their
philosophy was officially condemned. Although most of their ideas died out in
time, that of Allaah being everywhere (i.e. immanent) has remained to this day
among followers of the Ash _‘_ arite school.^5 This school was founded by scholars
who left the Mu _‘_ tazilite philosophy and attempted to to refute the excesses of
Mu _‘_ tazilite thought from a philosophical basis.

Danger of the Immanence Concept

On the basis of the false attribute of divine immanence (i.e. the “God is
everywhere” belief) some claimed that God was more in humans than in animals,
vegetation, minerals, etc. From that theory it was only a matter of time before
some claimed that God was more in them than in the rest of humans, either by
Hulool (indwelling of Allaah in man) or by Ittihaad (complete unification of the
human soul with Allaah’s “soul). Among Muslim people of the ninth century, a
deranged mystic and so-called saint, al-Hallaaj (858-992 CE), openly declared
that he and Allaah were one.^6 The Nusayrites, a breakaway Shi _‘_ ite sect of the

(^5) This school of scholastic theology takes its name from Abul-Hasan ‘Alee al-Ash‘aree (873-935
CE) a theologian born in Basrah who until his fortieth year was a zealous pupil of the Mu _‘_ tazilite
theologian al-Jubbaa’ee. After a study of Hadeeth elucidated for him the contradiction between
Mu _‘_ tazilite views and the spirit of Islaam, he began to champion the orthodox views. He is
considered the found of orthodox scholasticism (Kalaam) and his mot famous works are al-
Ibaanah _‘_ an Usool ad-Diyaanah (translated by W.C. Klein (New Haven, 1940) and Maqaalaat al-
Islaameeyeen, (Cairo: Maktabh an-Nahdah al-Misreeyah, 2nd ed., 1969). Towards the end to his
life al-Ash‘aree abandoned scholasticism altogether and relied solely on Hadeeth. However, other
theologians especially of the Shaafi _‘_ ite school of law adopted his earlier views and the Ash _‘_ arite
school took on a life of its own. Al-Baaqillaanee (d. 1013 CE) reduced asl-Ash‘aree’s refutation to
a system, established the intellectual basis and arranged the arguments. Among the leading
Ash _‘_ arite scholars following him were Imaam al-Haramayn (al-Juwaynee [d. 1086]), al-
Ghazzaalee (d. 1112) and ar-Raazee (d. 1210). (Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam), pp.46-7 and
pp.210-15).

tenth century, claimed that the Prophet’s son-in-law, ‘Alee ibn Abee Taalib, was
manifestation of Allaah^7 and another breakaway Shi _‘_ ite sect of the eleventh
century called the Druze ̧ claimed that the Fatimid Shi _‘_ ite caliph, al-Haakim bi
Amrillaah (996-1021 CE) was the last incarnation of God among men.^8 Ibn
‘Arabee (1165-1240 CE), another so-called Sufi saint of the twelfth century,
exhorted his followers in his poetry to pray to themselves and not to anything
outside of themselves because he believed the God was inside man.^9 This same
theory was the essence of Elijah Muhammad’s (d. 1975) claim in America that
black people were “Allaah” and that his mentor, Fard Muhammad, was the
supreme Allaah himself.^10 Reverend Jim Jones, who killed himself and 900 of his
followers in Guyana in 1979, is one of the most recent example of man claiming
to be God and people accepting it. In fact, Jim Jones learned his philosophy and
psychological techniques for manipulating the innocent from another American
who called himself Father Divine. Father Divine, whose real name was George
Baker, appeared during the early depression years of the 1920’s and opened
restaurants for the poor. After capturing their stomachs, he projected on them the
claim that he was god incarnate. In time he married and named his Canadian wife,
Mother Divine. By the mid-thirties his followers numbered in the millions and
were to be found all across the U.S.A. and even in Europe.^11

Thus, these claims of divinity were not limited to any particular place or
religious group. They simply took root wherever the soil was fertile. If minds
were already prepared by the belief in God’s immanence in His creation to accept
the man-god concept, then those who claimed divinity could easily find followers.

It may be concluded that the belief that “Allaah is everywhere” is
extremely dangerous primarily because it concourages, defends and rationalizes
the greatest sin in Allaah’s sight, the worship of His creation. It is also an aspect
of Shirk in Tawheed al-Asmaa was-Sifaat as it claims for God an attribute which
does not belong to Him. Neither in the Qur’aan nor on the tongue of the Prophet
(r) can such a description of Allaah be found. In fact, both the Qur’aan and the
Sunnah confirm the opposite.

Clear Proofs:

Since the greatest sin in God’s sight is the worship of others besides Him
or along with Him, and everything besides Him is His creation, the principles of
Islaam are all either directly or indirectly opposed to the worship of creation. The
fundamental tenets of the Faith make a very clear distinction between the Creator
and what He has created.

There are a number of proofs based on the essential elements of the
Islamic creed which have been used by orthodox Muslim scholars to establish the
fact that Allaah is totally separate from, and above His creation. The following are
seven such proofs:

1. A Natural Proof:

Man, from the Islamic viewpoint, is born with certain natural tendencies and is
not merely a product of his environment. This fact is based on the Qur’anic
passage in which Allaah explained that when He created Aadam, He extracted
from him all of his descendents and made them bear withess to His unity.^12 This
concept is further emphasised by the Prophet’s (r) statement that every new born
child is born with an inclination to worship Allaah, but its parents make it a Jew, a
Magian or a Christian.^13 Therefore, man’s natural reaction to the implications of
the “god is everywhere belief” may be used, to some degree, as a measure of its
accuracy. If Allaah exists everywhere and is present in everything, it would imply
that His essence could be found in filth and filthy places.. When confronted with
this implication, most people are naturally unable to accept any statement which
points to the fact that Allaah, the Creator of the Universe, is present in man’s
excrements or in any other items or places not befitting His majesty. Therefore, it
may be concluded that since man’s natural instincts, placed in him by Allaah,
reject the claim that Allaah is everywhere, it is highly unlikely that such a claim
would be correct. Those unwilling to give up the “God is everywhere belief”,
however, might argue that man’s repulsion towards this concept is a result of
upbringing and conditioning, and not really a result of natural instincts. But, the
vast majority of young children automatically reject this concept without any
hesitation or contemplation, even though most of them were previously
indoctrinated with the idea that Allaah is everywhere.

(^12) Soorah al-A‘raaf, (7):172.
(^13) Reported by Abu Hurayrah and collected by al-Bukhaaree (Sahih Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English),
vol.8, pp.369-90, no.597) and Muslim (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), vol.4, p.1399, no.6429).


2. The Prayer Proof:

According to the rules and regulations governing prayer in Islaam, places of
worship must be completely free from statues or pictorial representation of God or
His creation and the various positions of worship used in formal prayer (bowing,
prostrating, etc.) are prohibited from being directed to anyone or anything besides
God. If God were present everywhere; in every thing and in every individual, it
would be perfectly acceptable for people to direct worship towards each other or
even to direct worship towards themselves as the infamous Sufi “saint”, Ibn
‘Arabee, suggested in some of his writings. It would also not be possible to
logically convince an idol worshipper or one who worships trees or animals that
his method of worship is wrong and that he should only worship the unseen God,
Allaah, who is alone without partners. The idolater would merely answer that he
is not worshipping the object would merely answer that he is not worshipping the
object itself but the part of God which is inside of these objects or God who
incarnated Himself in human or animal forms. Yet Islaam classifies anyone who
does such an act as a Kaafir (disbeliever) regardless of the rationale. The fact is
that such an individual is prostrating before God’s creation. Islaam came to take
man away from the worship of man and other created beings, and lead them to the
worship of the Creator alone. Therefore, the commandments in Islaam concerning
worship clearly indicate that Allaah is not be found in created things; He is totally
separate from them. This position is further strengthened by a total ban in Islaam
on any pictorial representation of God or any other living being from the animal
world.

3. The Mi **‘** raaj Proof:

Two years prior to his migration to Madeenah, the Prophet (r) made a miraculous
night journey (Israa) from Makkah to Jerusalem where he (r) too the Mi _‘_ raaaj^14
up through the seven skies to the pinnacle of creation. This miraculous journey
was bestowed on him in order that he be in the direct presence of Allaah. It was
there, above the seventh heaven, that Salaah (formal prayer) was made
compulsory five times per day, Allaah spoke directly to the Prophet (r), and
Allaah revealed to him the last verses of Soorah al-Baqarah (Second Chapter of

(^14) The noun of instrument Mi _‘_ raaj (Lit. stairs or ladder) is actually the vehicle which took the (r)
up through the heavens. However, the ascension itself is commonly referred to by this name. (See
Lane’s, Arabic-English Lexicon, vol.2, pp.1966-7).


the Qur’aan).^15 If Allaah were everywhere there would have been no need for the
Prophet (r) to go anywhere. He could have been in the direct presence to Allaah
on the earth in his own house. Therefore, the incident of the miraculous ascension
of the Prophet (r) up through the heavens contains within it a subtle implication
that Allaah is above His Creation and not a part of it.

4. Qur **’** anic Proof:

The number of verses in the Qur’aan which state that Allaah is above His creation
are too numerous to count. They are found in almost every chapter of the Qur’aan,
either directly or indirectly. Among the indirect references are those which refer
to things rising up to God or descending from Him. For example, in Soorah al-
Ikhlaas, Allaah calls Himself _“_ As Samad _”_^16 which means: that to which things
rise. Such references are sometimes literal, as in the case of the angels about
whom Allaah said,

## سنةٍ أﹶلﹾف خمسِين مِقﹾداره كﹶانﹶ يومٍ فِي إِلﹶيهِ والروح الﹾملﹶائِكﹶةﹸ تعرج

and sometimes spiritual, as in the case of prayer and Dhikr about which Allaah
said,

Lord in truth, in order to strengthen those who believe, and as a
guide and glad tidings to Muslims. ”^20
```
Direct references can be found in both the divine names of God as well as in His
explicit statements. For example, Allaah calls Himself by the names _“_ Al- _‘_ Alee _”_
and _“_ Al-A _‘_ laa” both of which mean the highest, above which there is nothing. For
example, _“_ Al- _‘_ Alee Al- _‘_ AdHeem. _”_^21 _“_ Rabbikal-A _‘_ laa _”_^22 He also explicitly,
referred to Himself as being above His servants saying,

## عِبادِهِ فﹶوق الﹾقﹶاهِر وهو

```
“ He is al-Qaahir (the irresistable) above His worshippers. ”^23
```
and He also described His worshippers as,

## فﹶوقِهِم مِن ربهم يخافﹸونﹶ

```
“ Those, who fear their Lord who is above them. ”^24
```
Therefore, the Qur’aan itself clearly points out for those who contemplate its
meanings, that Allaah is high above His creation and not within it or surrounded
by it in any way.^25

5. Hadeethic Proof:

There is also ample evidence in the statements of the Prophet (r) which clearly
establish that Allaah is not on the earth or within His Creation. Like the Qur’anic
verses, some Hadeeths contain indirect references while others are direct. Among
the indirect or implied references are those which refer to the angels ascending up
to Allaah as in the Hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah in which he narrated that Allaah’s
messenger said, _“_ (A group of) angels stay with you at night and (another group
of) angels by daytime, and both groups gather at the time of _‘_ Asr (evening) and
Fajr (dawn) prayers. Then those angels who have stayed with you overnight,

(^25) al- _‘_ Aqeedah at Tahaaweeyah, pp.285-6.


ascend (to Heaven) and Allaah asks them (about you) - though He knows all
about you... _”_^26

Included among the indirect references are those which refer to Allaah
being above his throne which is itself above all creation. An example of this type
can be found in Abu Hurayrah’s report that the Prophet (r) said, _“_ When Allaah
completed creation, He wrote in a Book (which He kept) with Him above His
throne, _‘_ Verily My mercy will precede my anger. _”_^27

An example of a direct reference is the narration about the Prophet’s wife
Zaynab bint Jahsh who used to boast to the other wives of the Prophet (r) that
their families gave them away in marriage to the Prophet (r) while Allaah from
above the seven heavens gave her away in marriage.^28

Another may be found in the Du _‘_ aa (prayer) by which the Prophet (r)
taught the sick to pray for themselves,

## ((أسمك تقدس السماء في الذي اﷲ ربنا))

_“_ Rabbanaa Allaah alladhee fis-Samaa _’_ e Taqaddasasmuka. (Our Lord Allaah
who is above the heavens, may Your name be Holy...)^29

The following Hadeeth is perhaps the most explict of the direct references:

Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam said, _“_ I had a servant girl who used to tend to
my sheep in the area of Mount Uhud, near a place called al-Jawwaareeyah. One
day I came to see them only to find that a wolf had made off with a sheep from her
flock. Since I, like the rest of Aadam _’_ s descandants, am prone to do regretable
acts, I gave her a terrible slap in her face. When I cam to Allaah _’_ s Messenger ( _r_ )
with the story, he considered it a grave thing for me to have done. I said, _‘_ Oh
Messenger of Allaah ( _r_ ) couldn _’_ t I free her? _’_^30 He replied, _‘_ Bring her to me _’_ , so I
brought her. He (r) then asked her, _‘_ Where is Allaah? _’_ and she replied, _‘_ Above

(^30) Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim And Abu Daawood collected a Hadeeth transmitted by Abu Hurayrah in
which he reported that Allaah’s Messenger (r) said, _“_ When you hit (others), avoid the face. _”_ (See
Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), vol.4, p.1378, nos.6321-6 and Sunan Abu Dawud, (English
Trans.), vol.3, p.1256, no.4478). He was reported to have said, _“_ The expiation for slapping a slave
or beating him is to set him free _”_ (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), vol.3, pp.882-3, no.4078).


the sky. _’_ Then He asked her, _‘_ Who am I? _’_ and she replied, _‘_ You are Allaah _’_ s
Messenger. _’_ So he said, _‘_ Free her, for verily she is a true believer. _’”_^31

When testing the faith of others, the logical question to ask would be “Do
you believe in Allaah?” The Prophet (r) did not ask that question, because most
people at that time believed in Allaah, as the Qur’aan frequently mentions,

## اللَّ ه لﹶيقﹸولﹸن والﹾقﹶمر الشمس وسخر والﹾأﹶرض السماواتِ خلﹶق من سأﹶلﹾتهم ولﹶئِن

```
“ And if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth and
controls the sun and the moon, they will certainly say, ‘ Allaah. ’”^32
```
Because the pagan Makkans of that time believed that Allaah was somehow
present in their idols and thereby a part of creation, the Prophet (r) wanted to
determine if her belief was confused and paganistic like other Makkans or clearly
unitarian and according to the divine teachings. Hence, he asked a question which
would determine whether she knew that Allaah was not a part of His creation or
whether she believed that God could be worshipped in creation. Her answer that
Allaah is above the heavens has to be considered by true Muslims as the only
valid answer to the question “Where is Allaah?” because the Prophet (r) ruled
that she was a true believer on the basis of it. If Allaah is everywhere as some
Muslims today still contend, the Prophet (r) would have had to correct her
answer, _“_ Above the sky _”_ , since whatever was said in his presence which he did
not reject is considered, according to Islamic Law, Prophet (r) not only accepted
her statement, but he also used it as a basis for judge her to be a true believer.

6. The Logical Proof:

Logically speaking, it is obvious that in a case where two things exist, one
of those things must either be a part of the other and dependent on it like its
attributes, or it must exist by itself, distinct from the other. Thus, when God
created the world, He either created it inside Himself or outside of Himself. The
first possibility is unacceptable because it would mean that Allaah, the infinite
Supreme Being, has within Himself finite attributes of deficiency and weakness.
Therefore, He must have created the world outside of Himself as an entity distinct
from Himself yet depending on Him. Having created the world outside of
Himself, He either created it above Himself or below Himself. Since human
experience nowhere confirms prayer downwards, and being below creation

(^31) Collected by Muslim (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), vol.1, pp.271-2, no.1094).
(^32) Soorah al-‘Ankaboot, (29):61.


contradicts God’s majesty and supremacy, God must therefore be above His
creation and distinct from it.

As to the contradictory descriptive statements that God is neither
connected to the world nor separate from it, or that He is neither in the world nor
outside of it,^33 such words are not only illogical but they, in fact, deny God’s
actual existence.^34 Such claims relegate God to the surrealistic realm of human
thought where opposite can co-exist and the impossible exist (like three gods in
one).

7. The Consensus of Early Scholars:

The statements of the early scholars of Islaam confirming God’s
transcendence are too numerous to mention in this concise work. The 15th
century Hadeeth scholar, adh-Dhababee, wrote a book entitled al- _‘_ Uloo lil- _‘_ Alee
al- _‘_ AdHeem in which he gathered the statements of over 200 major scholars of the
past confirming Allaah’s transcendency.^35

A good example of such statements can be found in Mutee‘ al-
Bukhaaree’s report that he asked Abu Haneefah his opinion of a person who says
he does not know whether his Lord is in the heavens or on earth. Abu Haneefah
replied, ‘He has disbelieved, because Allaah has said, **“** The Most Merciful is
above the throne (Soorah Taahaa 20:5)’, and His throne is above His seven
heavens.” He (al-Balakhee) then said, “What if he said that He is above the throne
but he does not know whether the throne is in the heavens or on earth?” He (Abu
Haneefah) replied, “He has disbelieved because he has denied that He (Allaah) is
above the heavens and whoever denies that He is above the heavens has
disbelieved.”^36 Though many who follow the Hanafee school of law today claim
that Allaah is everywhere, the early followers did not hold that position. The
incident in which Abu Haneefah’s main student, Abu Yousuf, told Bishr al-

(^33) See Haashiyah al-Beejooree _‘_ alaa al-Jawharah, p.58.
(^34) al- _‘_ Aqeedah at-Tahaaweeyah, pp.290-1. See also Ahmad ibn Hanbal’s ar-Radd _‘_ Alaa al-
Jahmeeyah.

Tahaaweeyah, p.288.


mareesee^37 to repent when he denied that Allaah is above the throne, was recorded
in a number of books written during and about that era.^38

Summary:

Therefore, it can be safely said that according to Islaam and its key principle of
Tawheed,

1. Allaah is completely separate from His creation.
2. Creation neither surrounds Him nor is above Him in any way.
3. He, Allaah is above all things.

This is the classical conception of Allaah according to the sources of Islaam. It is
very simple and firm, and leaves no room for the type of misconceptions which
often lead to the worship of creation.

This vies, however, does not deny that Allaah’s attributes operate
throughout His creation. Nothing escapes His sight, His knowledge and His
power. But just as it is considered a major advance to technology to be able to sit
in the comfort of our homes and watch events taking place half-way around the
world, Allaah sees, hears and knows all that happens in the universe without
having to be inside of it. Ibn ‘Abbaas was reported to have said, “In Allaah’s
hand, the seven heavens, seven earths. their contents as well as what is between
them, is like a mustard seed in one of your hands”^39 And, just as remote-control
T.V. is considered a great technological improvement over manual control,
Allaah’s power operates unhindered within the smallest elements of creation
without Him having to be there. In fact, the concept that Allaah is within His
creation is really a form of Shirk in Tawheed al-Asmaa was-Sifaat where in
Allaah is given some of a man’s weaknesses. It is man who has to be present in
the world for him to see, hear, know and affect what takes place in it.

Allaah’s knowledge and power, on the other hand, has no bounds. Man’s
very thoughts are totally exposed to Allaah, and even the emotional workings of
his heart are subject to Allaah’s control. This is the light in which the few verses
which allude to Allaah’s closeness should be understood. For example, Allaah
said,

They simply mean that nothing escapes Allaah’s knowledge, even the innermost
thoughts of man, and nothing is beyond His power to control and change, even the
emotions of the heart. As Allaah said,

“ There is not a secret consultation between three, but He is their

```
should understood according to their context. By reading the preceding segment
of the same verse,

```
“ Can you not see that Allaah knows all that is in the heavens and on
earth? ”
```
and the concluding segment of the verse,

```
“ In the end He will tell them the truth of their conduct, on the Day
of Judgement for Allaah has full knowledge of all things. ”
```
It becomes clear that Allaah is here referring to His knowledge and not the fact
that His Supreme Being is present among men, for He is above and beyond His
creation.^46

As for the following statement which has been attributed to the Prophet (r),
“The heavens and earth cannot contain Allaah, but the heart of the true believer
contains Him,” it is inauthentic. But, even if it were taken at face value, there is
no way that a logical person could deduce from it that Allaah is in min. If a
believer’s heart literally contains Allaah, and the believer is contained with in the
heavens and earth, then Allaah is contained by the heavens and earth. Because, if
A is inside of B, and B is inside of C, then A must also be inside of C.

Therefore, according to the classical Islamic outlook based on the Qur’aan
and the Prophet’s Sunnah, Allaah is above the universe and its contents in a way
which befits His majesty and He is not in anyway contained within His creation
nor is it within Him, but His finite knowledge, mercy and power operate on every
particle within it without any hindrance whatsoever.^47

```
1.5 THE PURPOSE OF CREATION
```
THE PURPOSE OF CREATION IS A TOPIC THAT puzzles every human being at some
point in his or her lifetime. Everybody at some time or another asks themselves
the question “Why do I exist?” or “For what purpose am I here on earth?”

The variety and complexity of the intricate systems which constitute the
fabric of both human beings and the world in which they exist indicate that there
must have been a Supreme Being who created them. Design indicates a designer.

The Answer

To answer the question “Why did God create man?” it must first be
determined from which perspective the question is being asked. From the point of
view of God it would mean, “What caused God to create human beings?” while
from the human point of view it would mean “For what purpose did God create
humans?” Both points of view represent aspects of the intriguing question “Why
do I exist?”

This is not a topic for human speculation, because human guesswork cannot
possibly produce the whole truth in this matter. How can human beings
intellectually deduce the reality of their existence when they can hardly
understand how their own brain or its higher entity, the mind, functions?
Consequently, the many philosophers who have speculated on this question down
through the ages have come up with innumerable answers, all of which are based
on assumptions which cannot be proven. Questions on this topic have even led a
number of philosophers to claim that we do not really exist and that the whole
world is imaginary. For example, the Greek philosopher Plato (428-348 BC)
argued that the everyday world of changeable things, which man comes to know
by the use of his senses, is not the primary reality, but is a shadow world of
appearances.^1 Many others, as was previously mentioned, claimed and continue
to claim that there is no purpose for the creation of humans at all. According to
them, Human existence is merely a product of chance. There can be no purpose if
life evolved from inanimate matter which only became animate by pure luck.

(^1) This view was expressed in his book The Republic through his well known metaphor of the cave,
where the changing physical world is compared to shadows cast on the wall of a cave by graven
images (The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, vol. 25, p. 552).


Humankind’s supposed ‘cousins,’ the monkey and apes are not bothered with
questions of existence, so why should human beings be bothered with them?

Although most people put the question of why we are created aside after
occasional brief reflection, it is extremely critical for human beings to know the
answer. Without knowledge of the correct answer, human beings become
indistinguishable from the other animals around them. The animal necessities and
desires of eating, drinking and pro-creating become the purpose of human
existence by default, and human effort is then focused in this limited sphere.
When material satisfaction develops into the most important goal in life, human
existence becomes even more degraded than that of the lowest of animals.
Human beings will consistently misuse their God-given intelligence when they
lack knowledge of their purpose of existence. The degraded human mind uses its
abilities to create drugs and bombs and becomes engrossed in fornication,
pornography, homosexuality, fortunetelling, suicide, etc. Without knowledge of
the purpose of life, human existence loses all meaning and is consequently
wasted, and the reward of an eternal life of happiness in the hereafter is
completely destroyed. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that human beings
correctly answer the question “Why are we here?”

Humans most often turn to other human beings like themselves for the
answers. However, the only place that clear and precise answers to these
questions can be found is in the books of divine revelation. It was necessary that
God reveal the purpose to man through His prophets, because human beings are
incapable of arriving at the correct answers by themselves. All of the prophets of
God taught their followers the answers to the question “Why did God create
man?”

Judeo-Christian Scriptures

A survey of the Bible leaves the honest seeker of truth lost. The Old
Testament seems more concerned with laws and the history of early man and the
Jewish people than with answering the vital question concerning humanity’s
creation.^2

The Incarnation of God

(^2) In Isaiah the Israelites are created for God’s glory, “1 But now thus says the Lord, he who
created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: ...^6 ‘I will say to the north, Give up, and to the
south, Do not withhold; bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth,^7
every one who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.’ ”
(Revised Standard Version, Isaiah 43:1, 6-7.)


Perhaps the only common concept to most Christian sects regarding the
purpose of mankind’s creation is that God became man so that He could die at the
hands of men to cleanse them of sin inherited from Adam and his descendants.
According to them, this sin had become so great that no human act of atonement
or repentance could erase it. God is so good that sinful man cannot stand before
Him. Consequently, only God’s sacrifice of Himself could save humankind from
sin.

Belief in this man-made myth became the only source for salvation,
according to the Church. Consequently, the Christian purpose of creation became
the recognition of the ‘divine sacrifice’ and the acceptance of Jesus Christ as the
Lord God. This may be deduced from the following words attributed to Jesus in
the Gospel according to John, “For God so loved the world that he gave his
only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.”^3

Everything is God

The Hindu scriptures teach that there are many gods, incarnations of gods,
persons of God and that everything is God, Brahman. In spite of the belief that the
self (atman) of all living beings is actually Brahman, an oppressive caste system
evolved in which the Brahmins, the priestly caste, possess spiritual supremacy by
birth. They are the teachers of the Vedas^4 and represent the ideal of ritual purity
and social prestige. On the other hand, the Sudra caste are excluded from religious
status and their sole duty in life is “to serve meekly”^5 the other three castes and
their thousands of subcastes.

According to Hindu monist philosophers, humankind’s purpose is the
realization of their divinity and—following a path (marga) to emancipation
(moksha) from the wheel of rebirth — the reabsorbtion of the human soul (atman)
into the ultimate reality, Brahman. For those following the bhakti path,^6 the
purpose is to love God because God created humankind to “enjoy a relationship
— as a father enjoys his children” (Srimad Bhagwatam). For the ordinary Hindu,

(^3) John, 3:16 (RSV).
(^4) The Veda, meaning “Knowledge,” is a collective term for revealed (sruti; heard) sacred
scriptures of the Hindus. All other works—in which the actual doctrines and practises of Hindus
are encoded—are recognized as having being composed by human authors and are thus classed as
smriti (remembered). (The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, vol. 20, p. 530.)
(^5) Manava Dharmasastra 1.91 (The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, vol. 20, p. 553.)
(^6) The path of devotion to a personal God in which murtis (idols) are worshipped with the hope of
going to krishnaloka (a spiritual planet) in their next lives.


the main aim of worldly life lies in conforming to social and ritual duties, to the
traditional rules of conduct for one’s caste — the karma path.^7

In that final scripture, the Qur’aan (Koran), God revealed His purpose for
creating mankind and, through His last prophet, He clarified all of the details
which man could comprehend.

(^7) The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, vol. 20, p. 520.


Why Did God Create?

FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF GOD, AN EVEN more fundamental question needs to
be asked, “Why did God create?” This question should be asked because
humankind is not, in fact, the greatest creation. God says in Chapter Ghaafir of
the final revelation:

**يعلﹶمونﹶ لا الناسِ أﹶكﹾثﹶر لكِن و الناسِ خلﹾقِ مِن أﹶكﹾبر الأَرضِ و السمواتِ لﹶخلﹾق**

```
“ Indeed, the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the
creation of mankind, but most of mankind do not realize it. ”
Qur’aan, 40:57
```
The composition of human beings is far less complex than the composition of the
universe in which they exist. However, very few people reflect on this reality.

The Creator

Creation is fundamentally the consequence of the divine attribute of being
the Creator. A creator who does not create is something of a contradiction in
terms. This is not to say that God needs His creation. God is free from all needs.
It is creation which needs Him. But, as the greatness of a writer becomes
apparent in his writings, the perfection of the divine creative attribute is manifest
in creation. Creation in the true sense is unique to God alone.

Some ancient as well as modern philosophers, who could not
comprehend how God could create from nothing, claimed that the created world
and its contents are all originally a part of God.^8 That is, according to them, God
took a part of Himself and made the universe. This conclusion is based on
comparing God to man, who can only ‘create’ by modifying what already exists.
However, God denies any such comparisons which would give Him human
limitations. In Chapter ash-Shooraa of the final revelation, He states:

(^8) This is also Hindu belief regarding the supreme reality, Brahman. In the last (10th) book of the
Rigveda: in the “Hymn of the Cosmic Man” (Purusasukta), it is said that the universe was created
out of the parts of the body of a single cosmic man (Purusa) when his body was burned and
dismembered at the primordial sacrifice. The four castes emerge from his body: the priest
(Brahman) from the mouth, the warrior (Rajanya) from the arms, the peasant (Vaisya) from the
thighs, and the servant (Sudra) from the legs. ( The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, vol. 20, p.
531).


**الﹾبصِير السمِيع هو و شيءٌ كﹶمِثﹾلِهِ لﹶيس ...**

```
“ There is nothing like Him and He is hearer and seer of all. ” Qur’aan,
42:11
```
Thus, the act of creation is a consequence of the divine attribute of being the
Creator. God describes Himself as the Creator in a variety of verses throughout
the final revelation to emphasize to humankind that everything belongs to Him
alone.

“ Allaah created all things and He is the agent on which all things

“ And Allaah created you all and whatever you do. ” Qur’aan, 37:96
```
Man needs to realize that nothing takes place in this universe without the
permission of God. To seek protection from evil or to seek to acquire good from
any source other than God is a major mistake. Due to ignorance, many people
attempt to avoid misfortune and to gain good fortune through a variety of charms
and amulets, astrology, palmistry, etc. Consequently, in the final revelation,
Chapter al-Falaq, God informs human beings to seek refuge in God from evil:

**خلﹶق ما شر مِن الﹾفﹶلﹶقِ بِرب أﹶعوذﹸ قﹸلﹾ**

```
“ Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the dawn, from the evil of what He
has created. ” Qur’aan, 113:1-2
```
Allaah, God Almighty, is not evil; He is good. He created a world in which evil
or good can be done by beings to whom He gave this ability. However, no evil or


good can take place in this world without the permission of God. This is why it is
futile to turn to others besides God for help and protection.

**اﷲِ بِإِذﹾنِ إِلاَّ مصِيبةٍ مِن أﹶصاب ما**

```
“ No calamity strikes except by Allaah ’ s permission ” Qur’aan, 64:11
```
###### The final prophet of God, Muhammad (r), further elaborated on this concept,

saying, “Be aware that if the whole of mankind gathered together to do something
to help you, they would only be able to do something for you which Allaah had
already written for you. Likewise, if the whole of mankind gathered together to
harm you, they would only be able to do something to harm you which Allaah had
already written to happen to you.”^9

The Merciful, The Forgiving

In the creation of humankind, the divine attributes of forgiveness, mercy
and kindness are also manifested. Human beings were created good and pure with
a natural awareness of good and evil. The Almighty also created in humans
desires, and gave them an ability to control those desires according to divine law
or to turn them loose and follow them blindly. God created mankind knowing that
they would disobey Him. Consequently, He taught human beings, beginning with
Adam, how to repent and thereby purify themselves of their sins. Adam and Eve
represent a pattern for all mankind to follow. They forgot the commandment of
God, and Satan played on their desires. After they had disobeyed God, they turned
back to Him in repentance, and He forgave them. In humankind’s disobedience
and turning back to God in repentance, the divine attributes of total forgiveness
and infinite mercy become manifest. The final Prophet (r) informed his
followers of this reality, saying, “If you did not commit sins and turn to Allaah,
seeking His forgiveness, He would have replaced you with another people who
would sin, ask Allaah _’_ s forgiveness and He would forgive them.”^10 Every one of
the 114 Chapters of the final revelation, except one, begins with the prayer, “In
the name of Allaah, the Beneficent the Most Merciful.” Allaah’s attributes of
mercy and forgiveness are stressed to encourage humans not to fall into despair.

(^9) Reported by ‘Abbaas and collected by at-Tirmithee and authenticated in Saheeh Sunan at-
Tirmithee, vol. 2, pp. 308-9, no. 2043.
(^10) Sahih Muslim, vol. 4, pp. 1435-6, no. 6621, reported by Aboo Ayyoob al-Ansaaree.


No matter how great the sins of human beings may be, God can forgive them if
man turns back to Him in sincere repentance. The Messenger (r) was quoted as
saying, “When Allaah created the universe, He made an obligation on Himself
[recorded] in a document kept by Him: My mercy supersedes my wrath.”^11 He
was also reported to have said, “[Allaah created] mercy with one hundred parts,
one of which was sent down upon the jinn, human beings and other living beings.
It is out of this one part that they love each other, show kindness to each other
and even the animals treat their offspring with affection. Allaah has reserved the
remaining ninety-nine parts for His true worshippers on the Day of
Resurrection.”^12

Had Allaah wished, He could have created mankind like angels, incapable
of committing sin. However, that was not His wish, as He had already created
angels. Human beings were created capable of making mistakes and when they
realize their errors and seek God’s forgiveness, the divine attributes of mercy and
forgiveness become manifest.

Supreme Justice

In the judgment of mankind at the end of this world, God’s attributes of
supreme justice and fairness also become manifest. Based on His infinite
knowledge, God could have created all members of the human race who were to
live on earth and immediately placed some of them in paradise and the remainder
in hell. Before creating man, Allaah already knew what choices they would make
in this life, what provision and opportunities

If God had immediately placed those headed for paradise in paradise, they
would not question God’s decision. Those in paradise would happily accept an
everlasting life of bliss and be thankful that they were not placed in hell.
However, those immediately placed in hell would ask why. They would feel a
sense of unfairness due to their ignorance of what they would have done had they
lived on earth. Those in hell would relentlessly argue that had they been given a
chance to live out their lives on earth, they would have believed and done
righteous deeds. Consequently, Allaah allows human beings to live out their lives
on earth and make all the choices they would have made, so that everyone who
enters hell will know that they chose hell by themselves. They will recognize
God’s mercy in their lives and acknowledge their sin in rejecting His signs and
guidance. And they will accept His judgment as being just and beyond reproach.

(^11) Sahih Muslim, vol. 4, p. 1437, no. 6628, reported by Aboo Hurayrah.
(^12) Ibid., vol. 4, p. 1437, no. 6631, reported by Aboo Hurayrah.


However, they will still beg for another chance to do good in this world, as God
says in Chapter as-Sajdah of the Qur’aan:

**فﹶأﹶرجِعنا ا سمِعن و أﹶبصرنا ربنا ربهِم عِند رءُوسِهِم ناكِسوا الﹾمجرِمونﹶ إِذِ ترى لﹶو و**

**موقِنونﹶ إِنا صالِحا نعملﹾ**

```
“ If only you could see [the time] when the sinners will bow their
heads before their Lord, [saying], ‘ Our Lord! We have now seen and
heard, so send us back and we will do righteous deeds. Verily, we
now believe with certainty. ’ ” Qur’aan, 32:12
```
However, if Allaah were to send them back to this world having forgotten what
they had seen of hell, they would again choose evil and end up in hell as before.
God spoke about this in Chapter al-An _‘_ aam,

**لﹶكﹶاذِبونﹶ وإِنهم عنه نهواﹾ لِما لﹶعادواﹾ ردواﹾ ولﹶو**

```
“ But if they were returned [to this world], they would certainly go
back to what was forbidden to them. Indeed they are liars. ” Qur’aan,
6:28
```
Divine Love

God’s love is manifest in beings brought into existence, whether believer
or disbeliever, to enjoy life, if only for a brief moment. It is also realized in the
creation of paradise for those who choose righteousness over evil. Allaah states in
the final revelation that He loves those who do good (5:13), those who are just
(5:42), those who are pious (9:4), those who are patient (3:146), those who put
their trust in Him (3:159), those who frequently turn to Him in repentance and
those who purify themselves (2:222). However, it is He who has defined for
human beings through the scriptures and the prophets what is good, just and
pious. Consequently, those who follow the prophets are most beloved to God. In
Chapter Aal _‘_ Imraan, Allaah instructed Prophet Muhammad (r) to say the
following to the believers:


**ذﹸنوبكﹸم لﹶكﹸم ويغفِر اﷲُ يحبِبكﹸم فﹶاتبِعونِي اﷲَ تحِبونﹶ كﹸنتم إِنﹾ**

```
“ If you really love Allaah, follow me and Allaah will love you and
forgive your sins. ” Qur’aan, 3:31
```
The prophets should be followed not only in the compulsory acts ordained by
God, but also in their eagerness to do acts of voluntary worship.

The love of God is also manifest in His mercy and blessings which He
grants to those who deserve them as well as those who do not. But, it is
particularly manifest in His willingness to forgive the sins of whomsoever turns to
Him in sincere repentance. From the creation of Adam and Eve, repentance was
granted to them to erase their sins as an example to all human beings who would
follow them into this world. No matter how great human sins may become, the
door for sincere repentance remains open until the last day of this world. Anas
quoted Allaah’s Messenger (r) as saying, “Allaah, the Almighty, has said: O son
of Adam, as long as you call on Me and ask of Me, I will forgive what you have
done, and I do not mind. O son of Adam, even if your sins reached the clouds and
you asked My forgiveness, I will forgive you. O son of Adam, if you came to Me
with sins nearly as great as the earth and you met Me without giving Me partners,
I will give you a similar amount of forgiveness.”^13

Divine Grace

As for those in paradise, they will not enter it solely based on their good deeds. It
is the grace of God which will ultimately carry them there. The final Prophet of
Allaah (r) said in this regard, “Try your best to do right, and be happy. For none
will enter paradise only because of his deeds.” His companions said, “O
Messenger of Allaah! Not even you?” He replied, “Not even I, unless Allaah
envelops me in His mercy and grace.^14 And bear in mind that the deed most loved
by Allaah is one done constantly, even though it is small.”^15 However, God’s
grace is not arbitrary. It is based on both correct faith and righteous deeds. In
Chapter Aal _‘_ Imraan, Allaah says:

(^13) Collected by at-Tirmithee and authenticated in Saheeh Sunan at-Tirmithee, vol. 3, pp. 175-6, no.
2805.
(^14) Sahih Muslim, vol. 4, p. 1473, no. 6765, reported by Aboo Hurayrah.
(^15) Sahih Muslim, vol. 4, pp. 1473-4, no. 6770, reported by ‘Aa’ishah.


**لاﹶ هم و مِثﹾلﹶها إِلاَّ يجزى فﹶلاﹶ بِالسيئﹶةِ جاءَ من و أﹶمثﹶالِها عشر فﹶلﹶه لﹾحسنةِ بِا جاءَ من**

```
“ Whoever brings a good deed, will have [the value of] ten like it, and
whoever brings an evil deed will only be punished with one like it,
and they will not be wronged. ” Qur’aan, 6:160
```
Were God to hold humankind to account strictly, no one’s good deeds would
outweigh their evil deeds. However, God has manifested His grace by multiplying
the value of good deeds, while keeping evil deeds at their face value. It is by the
grace of God that the true believers enter Paradise. This does not mean that deeds
have no role. Deeds have a major role, but they are not the deciding factor. God’s
grace outweighs them.

Consequently, the creation of human beings, the errors that they make and
the good that they do are all circumstances for the manifestation of God’s
attributes of mercy and forgive-ness, His attribute of justice and His attribute of
grace.

Humankind should not question why God chose to manifest His attributes
in this way. It can only be assumed that this was the best way, because Allaah
describes Himself as being the Most Wise and the Most Knowledgeable. Humans
can only understand what Allaah chooses to reveal to them.

**شاءَ بِما إِلاَّ عِلﹾمِهِ مِن بِشيءٍ يحِيطﹸونﹶ ولاﹶ**

```
“ They will only encompass of His knowledge what He
wishes. ” Qur’aan, 2:255
```
Thus, they should not try to equate themselves with God. If He has told
humankind why He decided to do something, it is not for them to question why
He decided to decide. Such questions are without end and thus beyond human
scope. It is they who will be questioned on the Day of Judgment about their
actions and intentions and not He. In Chapter al-Ambiyaa, Allaah addresses this
point:

**يسأﹶلﹸونﹶ وهم يفﹾعلﹸ عما يسأﹶلﹸ لاﹶ**


```
“ He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be
questioned. ” Qur’aan, 21:23
```
In this regard Prophet Muhammad (r) was reported by Ibn ‘Abbaas to have said,
“Reflect on the creation of Allaah but do not reflect on Allaah.”^16 To reflect on
the reality of Allaah is to reflect on the infinite. And, as the mind boggles when it
reflects on the limits of the finite universe and the galaxies and stars within it, it
will be more confounded when it attempts to understand the uncreated. The
Prophet (r) warned that the satanic forces would seek to introduce doubts in the
hearts of the believers by raising unanswerable questions about God. Aboo
Hurayrah related that Allaah’s Messenger (r) said, “Satan will come to everyone
of you and ask: Who created this and that? _—_ until he questions: Who created
your Lord? When he comes to that, one should seek refuge in Allaah [say: I
affirm my faith in Allaah and His prophets]^17 and avoid [such thoughts].”^18

Why Did God Create Mankind?

FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HUMANKIND, THE QUESTION “Why did
God create man?” implies “For what purpose was man created?” In the final
revelation, this question is answered without any ambiguity. Humans are first
informed by God that every human being is born with an innate consciousness of
God. In Chapter al-A _‘_ raaf, Allaah said:

**أﹶلﹶست أﹶنفﹸسِهِم علﹶى وأﹶشهدهم ذﹸريتهم ظﹸهورِهِم مِن ءَادم بنِي مِن ربك ﹶذأﹶخ إِذﹾ و**

Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah, vol. 4, p. 12, no. 1788. There is also a similar narration from Ibn ‘Umar
collected by at-Tabaraanee in al-Awsat and al-Bayhaqee in Shu _‘_ ab al-Eemaan.

```
only their descendants. Will you then destroy us for what those liars
did? ’ ” Qur’aan, 7:172-3
```
Consequently, every human being is responsible for belief in God, which is
imprinted on each and every soul. It is based on this inborn belief that Allaah
defined the purpose of humankind’s creation in Chapter ath-Thaariyaat :

**لِيعبدونِ إِلاَّ ِنسلإا و الﹾجِن خلﹶقﹾت ما و**

```
“ I have created the jinn^19 and humankind only for My
worship. ” Qur’aan, 51:56
```
Thus, the essential purpose for which humankind was created is the worship of
God. However, the Almighty is not in need of human worship. He did not create
human beings out of a need on His part. If not a single human worshipped God, it
would not diminish His glory in any way, and if all of mankind worshipped Him,
it would not increase His glory in any way. God is perfect. He alone exists
without any needs. All created beings have needs. Consequently, it is humankind
that needs to worship God.

The Meaning of Worship

To understand why human beings need to worship God, one must first
understand what is meant by the term ‘worship.’ The English term ‘worship’
comes from the Old English weorthscipe meaning ‘honor.’ Consequently,
worship in the English language is defined as ‘the performance of devotional acts
in honor of a deity.’^20 According to this meaning, man is instructed to show
gratitude to God by glorifying Him. In Chapter an-Nasr of the final revelation,
Allaah says:

**ربك بِحمدِ حفﹶسب**

```
“ Glorify the praises of your Lord. ” Qur’aan, 110:3
```
(^19) The jinn are a class of invisible rational beings created by God from the elements of fire. They
were endowed by God with free will, like mankind. Consequently, some of them are righteous
believers and others are evil disbelievers. The evil among them are commonly called demons, evil
spirits, devils, etc.
(^20) The Living Webster Encyclopedic Dictionary, p. 1148.


In glorifying God, man chooses to be in harmony with the rest of creation which
naturally glorifies its Creator. Allaah addresses this phenomenon in many
chapters of the Qur’aan. For example, in Chapter al-Israa, Allaah states:

**ِهدِـبِحم حسبـي إِلاَّ شيءٍ مِن وإِنﹾ فِيهِن ومن والأَرض السبع السماوات لﹶه حتسب**

**تسبِيحهم تفﹾقﹶهونﹶ لاَّ ولﹶكِن**

```
“ The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them glorify
Him and there is nothing which does not glorify His praise.^21
However, you do not understand their glorification. ” Qur’aan, 17:44
```
However, in Arabic, the language of the final revelation, worship is called
_‘_ ibaadah, which is closely related to the noun _‘_ abd, meaning ‘a slave.’ A slave is
one who is expected to do whatever his master wills. Consequently, worship,
according to the final revelation, means ‘obedient submission to the will of God.’
This was the essence of the message of all the prophets sent by God to
humankind. For example, this understanding of worship was emphatically
expressed by Prophet Jesus in the Gospel according to Matthew, 7:21, “None of
those who call me _‘_ Lord _’_ will enter the kingdom of God, but only the one who
does the will of my Father in heaven.” It should be noted that ‘will’ in this quote
means ‘what God wants human beings to do’ and not ‘what God permits humans
to do,’ because nothing happens in creation without the will (permission) of God.
The ‘Will of God’ is contained in the divinely revealed laws which the prophets
taught their followers. Consequently, obedience to divine law is the foundation of
worship. In this sense, glorification also becomes worship when humans choose
to obey God’s instructions regarding His glorification.

The Need for Worship

Why do human beings need to worship and glorify God by obeying the
divinely revealed laws? Because obedience to divine law is the key to success in
this life and the next. The first human beings, Adam and Eve, were created in
paradise and later expelled from paradise for disobeying the divine law. The only
way for human beings to return to paradise is by obedience to the law. Jesus, the
Messiah, was reported in the Gospel according to Matthew to have made

(^21) The thunder is described as glorifying God in 13:13, the day and night in 21:20 and the
mountains in 38:18.


obedience to the divine laws the key to paradise: Now behold, one came and said
to him, _“_ Good teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life? _”_
So he said to him, _“_ Why do you call me good? No one is good but One, that is,
God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments. _”_^22 Also in
Matthew 5:19, Jesus Christ was reported to have insisted on strict obedience to
the commandments, saying, “Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these
commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of
heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven.”

Remembrance of God

All of the various acts of worship contained in the divine laws are
designed to help humans remember God.

```

“ Verily, I am Allaah, there is no god beside Me, so worship Me and
establish regular prayer for My remembrance. ” Qur’aan, 20:14
```
Regarding fasting, Allaah stated in Chapter al-Baqarah:

**مـلﹶعلَّ كﹸ قﹶبلِكﹸم مِن ِينذالَّ علﹶى بكﹸتِ كﹶما الصيام علﹶيكﹸم بكﹸتِ ءَامنواﹾ ِينذالَّ ياأﹶيها**

```
“ O you who believe! Fasting has been prescribed for you as it was
prescribed for those before you that you may become God-
conscious. ”
Qur’aan, 2:183
```
The believers are encouraged to remember God as much as possible.

(^22) Matthew 19:16-17 (RSV).


```
“ O believers! Remember Allaah often. ”
Qur’aan, 33:41
```
Remembrance of God is stressed because sin is generally committed when God is
forgotten. The final revelation, the Qur’aan, addresses this phenomenon in
Chapter al-Mujaadalah as follows:

**زبـِح إِنَّ لآأﹶ الشيطاﹶنِ ِزبح أﹸولﹶئِك اﷲِ ذِكﹾر فﹶأﹶنساهم الشيطﹶانﹸ علﹶيهِم اِستحوذﹶ**

“ Satan got the better of them and caused them to forget Allaah.

God, through Divine law, has prohibited intoxicants and gambling
primarily because they cause human beings to forget God.

“ Satan ’ s plan is to incite enmity and hatred among you with

Consequently, humankind need to remember God for their own salvation and
growth.

“ Those who, having done something shameful or having wronged

```
The Religion of Islaam


The most complete system of worship available to human beings today is
the system found in the religion of Islaam. The very name ‘Islaam’ means
‘submission to the will of God.’ Although it is commonly referred to as ‘the third
of the three monotheistic faiths,’ it is not a new religion at all. It is the religion
brought by all of the prophets of God for humankind. Islaam was the religion of
Adam, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. God addresses this issue in the final revelation
with regard to Prophet Abraham, saying:

**نـمِ انﹶـكﹶ اـوم سلِماـم اﹰنِيفح كﹶانﹶ ولﹶكِن انصرانِي ولاﹶ ايهودِي إِبراهِيم كﹶانﹶ ما**

**ينالﹾمشرِكِ**

```
“ Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was an upright
Muslim who did not worship others besides God. ” Qur’aan, 3:67
```
Since there is only One God, and humankind are one species, the religion
which God has ordained for human beings is one. He did not prescribe one
religion for the Jews, another for Indians, yet another for Europeans, etc. Human
spiritual and social needs are uniform, and human nature has not changed since
the first man and woman were created. Consequently, no other religion is
acceptable to God besides Islaam, as He clearly states in Chapter Aal _‘_ Imraan of
the final revelation:

**ِسلاﹶملإا اﷲِ عِند الدين إِنَّ**

```
“ Surely Allaah ’ s religion is Islaam. ” Qur’aan, 3:19
```
**ينالﹾخاسِرِ مِن ِةخِرلآا فِي وهو مِنه يقﹾبلﹶ فﹶلﹶن دِينا ِسلاﹶمِلإا ﹶيرغ ِغيبت ومن**

```
“ And whoever desires a religion besides Islaam will not have it
accepted, and he will be among the losers in the hereafter. ” Qur’aan,
3:85
```
Every Act Is Worship

In the Islamic system, each and every human act can be transformed into
an act of worship. In fact, God commands the believers to dedicate their whole
lives to Him. In Chapter al-An _‘_ aam, Allaah says:


**ينالﹾعالﹶمِ رب ِﷲ ومماتِي يومحيا ونسكِي صلاﹶتِي إِنَّ قﹸلﹾ**

```
“ Say: ‘ Surely my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are
for Allaah, the Lord of all the worlds. ’ ” Qur’aan, 6:162
```
However, for that dedication to be acceptable to Allaah, each act must fulfill two
basic conditions:

FIRST, THE ACT MUST BE DONE SINCERELY FOR the pleasure of God and not for the
recognition and praise of human beings. The believer also has to be conscious of
God while doing the deed to insure that it is not something forbidden by Allaah or
the last Messenger (r).

THE SECOND CONDITION IS THAT THE ACT BE done in accordance with the
prophetic way, called in Arabic the Sunnah. All of the prophets instructed their
followers to follow their way because they were guided by God. What they taught
were divinely revealed truths, and only those who followed their way and
accepted the truths would inherit eternal life in paradise. It is in this context that
Prophet Jesus, may the peace and blessings of God be upon him, was reported in
the Gospel according to John 14:6, as saying, “I am the way, the truth, and the
life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” Similarly, ‘Abdullaah ibn
Mas‘ood related that one day Prophet Muhammad (r) drew a line in the dust for
them and said, “This is Allaah _’_ s path.” He then drew several lines [branching off]
to the right and to the left and said, “These are the paths [of misguidance] on each
of which is a devil inviting people to follow it.” He then recited the verse: **“** Verily,
this is my path, leading straight, so follow it. And do not follow the [other]
paths for they will scatter you about from Allaah **’** s path. That is His
command to you in order that you may be conscious of Allaah.^23 **”**^24 Thus, the
only acceptable way to worship God is according to the way of the prophets. That
being the case, innovation in religious affairs would be considered by God among
the worst of all evils. Prophet Muhammad (r) was reported to have said, “The
worst of all affairs is innovation in religion, for every religious innovation is a
cursed, misleading innovation leading to the hellfire.”^25 Innovation in the religion

is forbidden and unacceptable to God. The Prophet (r) was also reported by his
wife, ‘Aa’ishah, to have said, “He who innovates something in this matter of ours,
that is not of it, will have it rejected.”^26

The Best of Creation

Those who believe in One Unique God, without partners or offspring, and
do righteous deeds [according to the above-mentioned principles] become the
crown of creation. That is, although humankind is not the greatest creation of
Allaah, they have the potential to become the best of His creation. In Chapter al-
Bayyinah, Allaah states this fact as follows:

**الﹾبرِيةِ خير هم أﹸولﹶئِك الصالِحاتِ عمِلﹸواﹾو ءَامنواﹾ ِينذالَّ إِنَّ**

```
“ Surely, those who believe and do righteous deeds are the best of
creation. ” Qur’aan, 98:6
```
The Gravest Sin

To contradict the purpose of one’s creation is then the greatest evil that a
human being can commit. ‘Abdullaah reported that he asked Allaah’s Messenger
(r) which sin is the gravest in Allaah’s sight and he replied, “To give Allaah a
partner, even though He created you.”^27 Worshipping others besides God, called
shirk in Arabic, is the only unforgivable sin. If a human being dies without
repenting from his or her sins, Allaah may forgive all their sins except shirk. In
this regard, God stated the following in Chapter an-Nisaa _’_ :

```

“ Surely Allaah will not forgive the worship of others besides Him,

```
“ And they denied [the signs] wrongfully and arrogantly, though
within themselves they were convinced of them. ” Qur’aan, 27:14
```
To atheists and materialists, life has no purpose beyond the fulfillment of their
desires. Consequently, their desires also become the god which they obey and
submit to instead of the One True God. In Chapter al-Furqaan of the final
revelation, Allaah said:

**ـل إِ ﹶذاتخ منِ أﹶرءَيت**

```
ا
ههوا ههـ
```
```
“ Have you seen the one who takes his desires as his god? ” Qur’aan,
25:43
```
Love of God

Shirk also occurs when human beings love, trust or fear the creation more
than Allaah. In Chapter al-Baqarah of the last revelation, God said:

**دـأﹶش ءَامنواﹾ ِينذوالَّ اﷲِ بكﹶح يحِبونهم أﹶندادا اﷲِ دونِ مِن ﹸذيتخِ من الناسِ ومِن**

**ِﷲ ابح**

```
“ There are among men those who worship others besides Allaah as
equals to Him. They love them as only Allaah should be loved. But
those who believe have a stronger love for Allaah. ” Qur’aan, 2:165
```
Anas ibn Maalik narrated that the Prophet (r) said, “Whoever possesses [the
following] three characteristics has tasted the sweetness of faith: he who loves
Allaah and His Messenger above all else; he who loves another human being for
Allaah _’_ s sake alone; and he who hates to return to disbelief after Allaah has
rescued him as he hates to be thrown into a fire.”^28

**تحصوها لاﹶ اﷲِ نِعمت تعدواﹾ وإِنﹾ**

```
“ If you try to count Allaah ’ s blessings, you will not be able to add
them up. ” Qur’aan, 14:34
```
(^28) Sahih Muslim, vol. 1, p. 30, no. 67.


However, the supreme love which humans should feel for God must not be
reduced to the common denominator of their emotional love for creation. Just as
the love humans feel for animals should not be the same as what they feel for
other humans,^29 the love of Allaah should transcend the love humans feel towards
each other. Human love of God should be, fundamentally, a love manifest in
complete obedience to the laws of God, as stated in Chapter Aal _‘_ Imraan, “If you
love Allaah, then follow me [the Prophet] and Allaah will love you.”^30 This is
not an abstract concept, because human love of other humans also implies
obedience. That is, if a loved one requests that something be done, humans will
strive to do it according to the level of their love for that person.

The love of God should also be expressed in the love of those whom God
loves. It is inconceivable that one who loves Allaah could hate those whom
Allaah loves and love those whom He hates. The Prophet (r) was quoted by
Aboo Umaamah as saying, “He who loves for Allaah and hates for Allaah, gives
for Allaah and withholds for Allaah, has perfected his faith.”^31 Consequently,
those whose faith is proper will love all those who love God. In Chapter Maryam,
Allaah indicates that He puts love in the hearts of the believers for those who are
righteous.

**اود منحالر لﹶهم سيجعلﹸ الصالِحاتِ وعمِلﹸواﹾ ءَامنواﹾ ِينذالَّ إِنَّ**

```
“ Surely, Allaah will bestow love [in the hearts of the believers for]
those who believe and do righteous deeds. ” Qur’aan, 19:96
```
Prayers

Prayers should only be directed to God alone, for only He can answer
prayers. He is accessible as long as He is called upon sincerely.

**دعانِ إِذﹶا الداعِي ﹶةدعو بيأﹸجِ بقﹶرِي فﹶإِني عني يعِبادِ سأﹶلﹶك وإِذﹶا**

humans are left to starve and die of disease is among the major crimes of the 20th century.

```
“ When My servants ask you [O Muhammad] about Me, [tell them]
that I am near, I answer the prayer of everyone who calls on
Me. ” Qur’aan, 2:186
```
The Prophet (r) emphasized this point, saying, “If you ask in prayer, ask only
Allaah, and if you seek help, seek it only from Allaah.”^32 Thus, prayer to human
beings or through human beings, dead or living, is a form of shirk. The one to
whom prayers are directed becomes an object of worship. An-Nu‘maan ibn
Basheer reported that the Prophet (r) said, “Supplication is worship.”^33

```
“ Surely, those whom you call on in prayer besides Allaah are

```
Thus, the Catholic Christian practice of praying to saints is shirk. If something is
lost, Saint Anthony of Thebes is prayed to in order to help find it.^34 St. Jude
Thaddaeus is the patron saint of the impossible and is prayed to for intercession in
incurable illnesses, unlikely marriages or the like.^35 And it used to be that when
someone set out on a journey, Saint Christopher, the patron saint of travelers, was
the object of prayers for protection. However, in 1969 St. Christopher was
unceremoniously struck off the list of saints by papal decree, after it was
confirmed that he was fictitious.^36 Prayers to Mary, the mother of Jesus, and to
the angels, as on Michaelmas^37 are also shirk. Even Christians who shun saint
worship commit shirk whenever they direct prayers to Prophet Jesus, through him
or in his name. Likewise, any Muslim who prays to Prophet Muhammad (r)

followers as follows in Chapter al-A _‘_ raaf:

even from myself, except if Allaah wills. If I had knowledge of the

would have befallen me. ” Qur’aan, 7:188
```
Aboo Hurayrah reported that when the verse “Warn your nearest relatives,”^38
was revealed to the Prophet, he said the following to his relatives: “O people of
Quraysh, secure deliverance from Allaah [by doing good deeds], for I cannot
avail you at all against Allaah...O Faatimah, daughter of Muhammad, ask me
whatever you wish [in this life], but I have nothing which can avail you against
Allaah.”^39

Why Did God Create Mankind on Earth?

The question concerning the purpose of mankind’s creation may be expanded to
include the world in which they live. The question would then be, “Why did God
create human beings in this world?”

(^40) “We” in the original Arabic is the majestic ‘we,’ referring to God.


It should be noted, however, that the tests of conduct are not to inform
God about humankind, for He knew everything there was to know about them
before He created them. The tests serve to confirm on the Day of Judgment that
those going to hell deserve it and those going to paradise only got there by God’s
grace. With regard to human beings in this life, the test of conduct serves two
basic purposes: one, human spiritual growth, and the other, punishment or reward.

Spiritual Growth

Generosity and Contentment

For example, in all human societies the qualities of generosity and
contentment are considered among the most noble characteristics. However,
neither of these traits can develop if everyone has the same amount of wealth.
Generosity can only be acquired when the human soul—aware that sharing with
the needy is good—struggles against its desire to hoard its possessions. On the
other hand, contentment is produced when the soul defeats the evils of envy and
greed. The Creator wisely sets the stage for these spiritual struggles by unequally
distributing wealth in this world. In Chapter an-Nahl of the final revelation,
Allaah says:

**ِقزالر فِي ٍضبع علﹶى كﹸمضبع لﹶضفﹶ واﷲُ**

```
“ Allaah has favored some of you over others in sustenance. ” Qur’aan, 16:71

“ O believers! Do not allow your wealth and children to divert you
from the remembrance of Allaah. ”
Qur’aan, 63:9
```

```
“ He raised some of you over others in rank to test you with what He
granted you. ” Qur’aan, 6:165
```
The desire to accumulate wealth cannot be satisfied in this life. The more
human beings have, the more they want. The Prophet (r) stated, “If a man had a
valley of gold, he would desire another, for nothing will fill his mouth but the dirt
[of his grave]. And Allaah forgives whoever sincerely repents.”^41

**بِها وتزكِّ يهِم تطﹶهرهم ﹰصدقﹶة أﹶموالِهِم مِن ﹾذخ**

```

```
“ And in their wealth the beggars and needy have a right. ” Qur’aan, 51:19
```
However, giving in charity should be done sincerely for the pleasure of God

ا
```
```
“ O believers, do not destroy your acts of charity by reminders of
your generosity and by injury. ”
Qur’aan, 2:264
```
Craving for wealth is further enhanced by envy. Consequently, God also
instructed us not to desire what He has given others.

“ Do not wish for that by which Allaah has favored some of you over
others. ” Qur’aan, 4:32
```
(^41) Sahih Al-Bukhari, vol. 8, pp. 297-8, no. 447.


The Prophet (r) reiterated this divine piece of advice, saying, “Look to those less
fortunate than you, and do not look to those above you; it is better for you, in
order that you do not deny what Allaah has blessed you with.”^42 Aboo Hurayrah
quoted the last Messenger (r) as saying, “Wealth is not [measured] in property,
but in contentment.”^43

```
الﹾقﹸلﹸوب تطﹾمئِن اﷲِ ِكﹾرِذبِ أﹶلاﹶ
“ Indeed, it is in the remembrance of Allaah that hearts find
rest. ” Qur’aan, 13:28
```
Calamities

Tests of this life also come in the form of ‘misfortune’ and calamities
which contribute to the spiritual growth of the true believers and purify them of
sin. Conversely, life’s tests of misfortune remind errant believers to return to the
correct path, and they punish disbelievers in this life before the next.

Patience

Calamities are the foundation on which the higher spiritual quality of
patience is developed. Consequently, it is not surprising to find that the righteous
are subject to many tragedies and difficulties in their lives. Sa‘d reported that he
asked the Prophet (r) who among mankind had the most trials, and he replied,
“The prophets, then those most like them and then those most like them. Man is
tested according to the level of his faith. If his faith is firm, his trials increase in
severity, and if there is weakness in his faith, he will be tried accordingly.”^44

True patience is the product of complete trust in God at the time of
calamity.

```
“ Surely only a disbelieving people despair of Allaah ’ s

Consequently, God has informed humankind that the punish-ment for those
who harbor evil thoughts about Him is the eternal torment of hell. In Chapter al-
Fat-h Allaah says:

**سوءِـال ظﹶن بِاﷲِ ينالظَّ ان والﹾمشرِكﹶاتِ ينوالﹾمشرِكِ والﹾمنافِقﹶاتِ ينالﹾمنافِقِ ب ِّذويع**

```
“ That He may punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the
idolaters, men and women, who harbor evil thoughts about Allaah.
An evil torment will encompass them, for Allaah is angry with them
and curses them. And He has prepared hell for them; an evil
end. ” Qur’aan, 48:6
```
Hope

On the other hand, the divine promises of justice and mercy fill the
believers with the confidence necessary to patiently face the difficulties of this
life. Consequently, hope in the mercy of God is an essential part of faith.

**ابِرِينالص مع اﷲَ إِنَّ ِةوالصلاﹶ بِالصبرِ استعِينواﹾ ءَامنواﹾ ِينذالَّ أﹶيها آي**

```
“ Surely those who believed, emigrated and strove for the sake of
Allaah, hope for Allaah ’ s mercy, for Allaah is Oft-Forgiving Most-
Merciful. ” Qur’aan, 2:218
```
Of course, paradise is the reward for patience based on sincere belief in God. God
informs the believers of their reward as follows:

**راجِعونﹶ إِلﹶيهِ آوإِن لِلَّ هِ إِنا قﹶالﹸواﹾ مصِيبةﹲ أﹶصابتهم آإِذ ِينذالَّ الصابِرين بشرِ و**

```
“ ...so announce glad tidings [of paradise] to those who are patient;
those who, when afflicted with calamity, say: Truly we belong to
Allaah and to Him we will return. ” Qur’aan, 2:155-6
```
Patience is also based on the belief that whatever befalls mankind is
fundamentally a consequence of their own evil deeds.^45

**ٍيركﹶثِ عن ويعفﹸواﹾ أﹶيدِيكﹸم كﹶسبت فﹶبِما مصِيبةٍ مِن أﹶصابكﹸم آوم**

```
“ Whatever befalls you is a result of what your hands have earned.
And He pardons much. ”
Qur’aan, 42:30
```
The fact is, God has excused humans for much of their evil. Were He to punish
them strictly according to their deeds, they and all on earth would be destroyed.
God addresses this issue in Chapter Faatir as follows:

**بةٍآد مِن ظﹶهرِها علﹶى كتر ما كﹶسبواﹾ بِما الناس اﷲُ ﹸذاخِؤي لﹶو و**

```
“ And if Allaah were to punish people for what they earned, He
would not leave a living creature on the face of the earth. ” Qur’aan,
35:45
```
Suhayb ibn Sinaan related that the Messenger of Allaah (r) said, “The affair of
the believer is amazing! The whole of his life is beneficial, and that is only in the
case of the believer. When good times come to him, he is thankful and it is good

(^45) In fact, all of the corruption on earth is a product of human misdeeds. Allaah states that in
Chapter ar-Room (30):41, quoted later in this booklet.


for him, and when bad times befall him, he is patient and it is also good for
him.”^46 This is the state of one who has accepted God’s destiny. Consequently,
belief in both the good and the apparent evil of what has been destined is the sixth
pillar of faith in Islaam.

On the other hand, if the believers experience a life devoid of any
problems, it should be taken as a sign that something is wrong. Under such
circumstances, the true believer must take time out and reflect on the realities of
his or her life. Either the tests are not obvious and they are unaware of them or
they have deviated from the right path.

```
“ Do not be awed by their wealth or their children. Allaah only
wishes to punish them with these things in this life and allow their
souls to die while they are in a state of disbelief. ” Qur’aan, 9:85
```
This is not to say that the believers should yearn for problems and calamities in
their lives, for Allaah has taught them to pray: “Our Lord, do not put on us a
burden like what you placed on those before us. **”**^47 Instead, they should thank
Allaah for whatever trials He has spared them. However, in times of ease they
must remain vigilant and not become oblivious to tests, for success and happiness
often blind people to the trials of life.

Reminder

Tests sometimes serve as a punishing reminder to those who have gone
astray and an encouragement for them to return to the correct path. When people
deviate, they seldom listen to the advice of those around them. However, when a
calamity strikes them or those near and dear to them, it jolts those who still have
some faith into recognizing their error.

punishment that perhaps they may return [to the right path]. ”

The test of calamities which remind humankind of their deviation may come in
the form of man’s inhumanity to his fellow man, as in the case of the unspeakable
atrocities unleashed by the Serbs against the Bosnian Muslims who had strayed
far away from Islaam, or Saddam’s brutal invasion of Kuwait and America’s
subsequent indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets in Iraq.

Hypocrisy

Calamities also expose those who falsely claim faith, as well as show
those who disbelieve that they choose hell by their own free will.

Punishment

Those who transgress the limits set by God expose themselves to
punishment in this life and the next. Throughout the Qur’aan, Allaah describes
numerous past nations who rejected divine guidance and were subsequently
destroyed. These stories serve as warnings to humanity of the consequences of
rebellion against the commandments of God. In Chapter an-Noor, Allaah gives a
general warning as follows:

**أﹶلِيم ﹶابذع يصِيبهم أﹶو فِتنةﹲ تصِيبهم أﹶنﹾ ِهأﹶمرِ عن يخالِفﹸونﹶ ِينذالَّ ﹶرِذفﹶلﹾيح**

```
“ Let those who contradict his command beware a trial or a severe
punishment. ” Qur’aan, 24:63
```
The punishment may come in a variety of different ways. Perhaps the most
obvious punishment afflicting humankind in all countries today is the disease
AIDS,^50 which appeared for the first time in medical history in the beginning of
the ’ 80 ’s. However, medical statistics show that such cases are relatively few in
comparison to the other categories. In any case, Allaah has warned in Chapter al-
Anfaal of the final revelation that when His punishment comes it is not limited to
the evil, but affects the society as a whole.

“ Beware of a trial which will not afflict only the sinful among you,
and know that Allaah is severe in punishment. ” Qur’aan, 8:25
```
One thousand four hundred years ago Prophet Muhammad (r) prophesied the
coming of such a trial. Ibn ‘Umar quoted him as saying, “Whenever promiscuity
is openly practiced among a people, a plague and anguish will spread among
them which was unknown to their predecessors.”^51 However, AIDS is only one in
a series of diseases. Before AIDS, a warning came in the form of another disease
called herpes, which became widespread among the sexually promiscuous
beginning in the 1960s and ’70s

(^50) Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a condition transmitted by a virus which
attacks the body’s system of defence against disease, leaving the sufferer extremely vulnerable to
disease and likely to die eventually from any one that he or she catches. (Chambers Pocket

2.1 COLLECTION OF THE QUR’AAN
```
The Arabic word Tafseer is used to mean “explanation of the Qur’aan.” The
science of Tafseer is called Usool at-Tafseer which refers to the fundamental rules
and information necessary for the correct understanding of the Qur’aan. In this
section on the Fundamentals of Tafseer (Usool at-Tafseer), we will look at how
the Qur’aan was written and compiled into one book, as well as the significance
of the knowledge.

A. ERA OF THE PROPHET (r) 609-632 C.E.^1

The Qur’aan was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (r) in sections throughout the
twenty-three years of his prophethood. Whenever a problem arose or whenever
Allaah wanted to give the Prophet (r) and his followers special advice, Allaah
would send angel Jibreel with a part of the Qur’aan which he would recite to the
Prophet (r). Thus, the Qur’aan was not revealed all at once in its complete form,
like the earlier books of revelation, but in parts over a period of time.

Preservation of the Qur’aan

When Jibreel first recited a part of the Qur’aan to the Prophet (r), the Prophet (r)
tried to repeat it after him, word for word. Allaah later had Jibreel tell him not to
do so. He was told instead to listen to the Qur’aan carefully. When the (r) did
that Allaah caused him to be able to remember everything without any effort on
his part. Allaah said in the Qur’aan:

###### فﹶإِذﹶا ( 17 ) وقﹸرآنه جمعه علﹶينا إِنَّ ( 16 ) بِهِ لِتعجلﹶ لِسانك بِهِ تحرك لاﹶ

###### قﹸرآنه فﹶاتبِع قﹶرأﹾناه

```
“ Do not move your tongue to hastily (learn) it. Surely we will
collect it and recite it. So, when we recite it, follow its recital. ”^2
```
(^1) C.E. (i.e. Christian Era) is used instead of A.D. (Anno Domini, lit. in the year of our Lord)
because Muslims do not recognize Jesus, the son of Mary, as the Lord, but as a Prophet of the
Lord God.
(^2) Soorah al-Qiyaamah (75):16-8.


It was very important that the Prophet (r) remember all that was revealed to him,
because he could neither read nor write.

The Prophet (r) passed on all of the Qur’aan to his companions before he died.
He used a number of different ways to make sure that they memorized and
recorded it exactly as he learned it.

1. The Prophet (r) used to recite aloud various parts of the Qur’aan in the
    Salaahs (Congregational Prayers). In that way, his followers used to hear
    parts of the Qur’aan daily.
2. Everyone who entered Islaam would be taught parts of the Qur’aan which
    they would have to use in their daily prayers. Thus, Muslims were always
    learning or teaching various parts of the Qur’aan.
3. The Prophet (r) informed his followers that the best of them were those
    who learned and taught the Qur’aan. This encouraged them to make even
    greater efforts to memorize the Qur’aan and teach it to others.
4. Those who were able to read and write were told by the Prophet (r) to
    write down the various sections of the Qur’aan as they were revealed. The
    Prophet (r) would tell them the order in which they record the verses.

Because there was no paper in Arabia at that time, the Qur’aan was written down
on anything which was available. The companions wrote the verses of Qur’aan on
date palm leaves, flat stones, tree bark, wood, dried animal skins and even the
shoulder blades of sheep or camels. Thus, the verses of the Qur’aan were
preserved in the hearts of the Muslims, as well as written down, during the
lifetime of the Prophet (r). Since people entered Islaam at various points during
the Prophet’s (r) mission, only a few of them heard all of the Qur’aan directly
from the Prophet (r). Also some companions were able to memorize better than
others. So, even though all of them memorized portions of the Qur’aan, only a
few were able to memorize all of the Qur’aan during the Prophet’s (r) lifetime.


When the Prophet (r) died in the year 632 C.E., the whole of the Qur’aan was not
written down one complete book. It was recorded on various pieces of writing
material and kept in the possession of different followers of the Prophet (r). Each
had sections but none of them had all. Because of the fact that the verses of the
Qur’aan continued to be revealed up until a few months before the Prophet’s (r)
death, the companions were more concerned with recording and memorizing it
than putting it all together in one book. Consequently, the gathering of the
Qur’aan into one text was not done during the Prophet’s (r) lifetime.

B. THE ERA OF ABU BAKR 632-634 C.E.

After the death of the Prophet (r), there arose three main groups opposed to
Islaam in the Arabian peninsula.

1. The first group was made up of those who decided that they did not want
    to pay the Islamic tax, Zakaah, to anyone other than the Prophet (r). They
    did not feel that Zakaah was a pillar of Islaam just like Salaah, Sawm and
    Hajj. They instead looked at Zakaah as tribute; a kind of tax paid to the
    one who conquered them. So, when the Prophet (r) died, they felt that
    they were no longer required to pay it. When Abu Bakr became the leader
    of the Muslim state, this group refused to pay the Zakaah and sent armies
    to the capital, Madeenah, in order to topple the Muslim state. They
    demanded to be excused from paying Zakaah or else they would attack
    and destroy the centers of Islaam.
2. The first group was joined by those who had entered Islaam in order to
    escape defeat, as well as those who simply wanted to be on the winning
    side. This group did not believe in Allaah and His Messenger at all. They
    wanted to destroy Islaam so they could be free to do whatever they wanted
    to do. Since the armies of those who refused to pay Zakaah appeared
    strong, many of these hypocrites joined them.
3. The third group was the false prophets and prophetesses. In the Najd, in
    the region of Yamaamah, an Arab from the tribe of Haneefah called
    Mysaylima claimed prophethood. In the southern part of Arabia, another
    Arab from the tribe of ‘Ans called al-Aswad, claimed prophethood and
    took over Najraan. To the north of Arabia an Arab woman called Sajaah
    from the Tameem tribe also claimed prophethood and rose in arms against


```
the Muslim state. These false prophets all invited people to leave Islaam
by claiming that Allaah had revealed to them new laws making allowable
most of the things which were forbidden by Prophet Muhammad (r).
```
True Muslims under the leadership of Caliph Abu Bakr, were forced to fight these
three groups in order to re-establish Islaam throughout the Arabian peninsula.

The First Writing

During these wars known as the Riddah (apostasy), many of those who had
memorized large portions of the Qur’aan were killed. Those Muslims who had a
lot of Qur’aan in their hearts knew well the rewards which Allaah has promised
those who fight for Islaam. So, they would always be in the front lines of all the
battles.

‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab realized the danger of what was happening and feared that
if something was not done immediately, the Qur’aan would be lost to future
generations of Muslims. So he went to Caliph Abu Bakr and advised him to have
the whole Qur’aan written down in one book in order to preserve it from being
lost. Abu Bakr at first refused to do so, because the Prophet (r) had not told men
to do it. He was afraid of bringing anything new into the religion because the
Prophet (r) had warned them about changing the religion. Christians had gone
astray before them because they changed the religion which Prophet ‘Eesaa
brought after he left them. So Abu Bakr was very much against making any
changes in the religion which Prophet Muhammad (r) had not told them to do.
However, after thinking over the situation very carefully, he came to realize that
‘Umar’s advice was right and that it was not really a change in the religion. The
Prophet (r) had ordered them to write down the various verses and chapters of
the Qur’aan, while it was being revealed, in order to help preserve it. Compiling
all of what was written into one complete book was then only the completion of
what the Prophet (r) had begun.

Caliph Abu Bakr asked Zayd ibn Thaabit to be in charge of collecting and writing
down the whole Qur’aan. Zayd at first refused to do it for the same reasons that
Abu Bakr had, but after some time he also came to realize that it was right. Zayd
was chosen because he was:

1) One of the best reciters of the Qur’aan.


2) One of the few who had memorized the whole Qur’aan during the Prophet’s
(r) lifetime.

3) One of those whom the Prophet (r) asked to write down the Qur’aan.

4) One of the few who were present when the Prophet (r) recited the whole
Qur’aan during the last Ramadaan of his life.

Zayd began the process by collecting all of the material on which the Qur’aan had
been written. He then gathered around him all of those who had also memorized
all of the Qur’aan or large portions of it. He then compared what was written
down with what he and others had memorized. If all agreed, he would then write
it down on pages of leather. In this way the whole Qur’aan was written down
during the reign of the first Caliph. On its completion, Zayd turned it over to
Caliph Abu Bakr who kept it until his death, two years after he had become
Caliph. Just before his death, Abu Bakr turned over the Qur’aan to ‘Umar whom
he had chosen to be the second Caliph. ‘Umar kept this copy of the Qur’aan with
him until his death, ten years later, at the hand of an assassin named Abu Lu’lu.’
The Qur’aan was then turned over to his daughter, Hafsah, who was also one of
the Prophet’s (r) wives. Hafsah kept the Qur’aan in her house in al-Madeenah,
but she made it available to anyone who to make copies from it, or check the
accuracy of what they had memorized.

C.THE ERA OF **‘** UTHMAAN 644-656 C.E.

After the death of the second Caliph, ‘Umar, a committee made up of six of the
most famous companions of the Prophet (r) chose ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan to be
the third Caliph.

During the reign of Caliph ‘Umar (634-644 C.E.), the Islamic state expanded
beyond the borders of the Arabian peninsula into Egypt, Syria and Iraq. In the
subsequent reign of Caliph ‘Uthmaan, the expansion continued on into Persia,
India, Russia, China, Turkey and across North Africa. Many of the people of
these regions accepted Islaam and learned the recitation of Qur’aan from the early
Muslims. The Qur’aan was revealed to the Prophet (r) in seven different Arabic
dialects, and the early Muslims taught the Qur’aan in its different readings.


The Second Writing

In the Muslim provinces, some Arabs began to boast that their dialect was

superior to that of others. Also, when new Muslims made mistakes in their
recitation of the Qur’aan, it was sometimes difficult to tell whether it was really

an error or whether it was one of the seven readings which were taught by the

Prophet (r). These problems eventually became a source of confusion in the
Muslims provinces outside of Arabia. One of the prophet’s companions

(Sahaabah) by the name of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan noticed the confusion

while he was in Itaq, and feared that it might lead to a breakup of the Muslim
nation and the changing of the Qur’aan. On his return to the capital, he informed

Caliph ‘Uthmaan of what he had heard and seen. Caliph ‘Uthmaan realized the
seriousness of the situation and called the major Sahaabah together in order to

find a solution to the problem. They decided to make official copies of the
Qur’aan from the one compiled in Caliph Abu Bakr’s time and limit the people to

its recitation.

‘Uthmaan asked Hafsah for the original copy of the Qur’aan and called on Zayd
ibn Thaabit to head a committee of four Qur’anic scholars who would take on the

task of making the official copies. When the copies were completed, the original

was returned to Hafsah. A total of seven copies were made and one was sent to
Makkah, another to Syria, one to Basrah, one to Kufah, one to Yemen, one to

Bahrain and one was kept in the capital, al-Madeenah. Caliph ‘Uthmaan sent an
official reciter of the Qur’aan with each copy in order to clear up any problems

which might later arise. He also ordered that all other copies of the Qur’aan be
destroyed, as people had made notes in their personal copies and some copies

were incomplete. All new copies were then made from the official copy called

Mus-haf Uthmaan, and in that way the Qur’aan was saved from any kind of
change or loss. This process was completed in the year 646 C.E., two years after

‘Uthmaan became the new Caliph.

MEMORIZATION OF THE QUR **’** AAN


Although the total number of Sahaabah who had memorized all of the Qur’aan

and read it back to the Prophet (r) before his death were only eight, many others
memorized it after his death. In fact, with every succeeding generation of
Muslims, the numbers of those who memorized all of the Qur’aan has increased.

Today there are literally hundreds of thousands of Muslims throughout the world

who have done so.

There is no other book, religious or otherwise, which has been memorized on this

scale in recorded history. The Qur’aan is about four fifths the length of the New
Testament of the Christians, yet not a single person in recorded history is known

to have memorized the New Testament completely. In fact, if all of the books in
the world were somehow to be destroyed, the only book which could be rewritten,

word for word without a single mistake is the Glorious Qur’aan.

Significance Of The Qur’aan’s Preservation

Allaah promised in the Qur’aan that He would take on the responsibility of

protecting His final Word from loss. He said,

###### لﹶحافِظﹸونﹶ لﹶه وإِنا الذِّ كﹾر نزلﹾنا نحن إِنا

```
“ Verily We have revealed the Reminder (Qur ’ aan) and verily We
shall preserve it. ”^3
```
Thus, the Qur’aan has been preserved in both the oral as well written from the
way no other religious book in history has been.

Why did Allaah preserve the Qur’aan and allow His earlier Books of Divine
Revelation to be changed or lost? The answer to that question lies in the following
three facts:

1. The earlier prophets and their Books were sent to particular people in
    particular periods of history. Once the period ended, a new prophet was sent
    with a new Book to replace the previous Book. So, it was not necessary that
    these Books be preserved by Allaah, Himself. The preservation of the earlier

(^3) Soorah al-Hijr (15):9.


```
Books was left up to the people as a test for them. Thus, when the people went
astray, they changed what was written in the books which the prophets
brought, in order to make allowable the things which were forbidden to them.
In that way all of the earlier Books of Revelation became either changed or
lost.
```
2. The Prophet Muhammad (r) was the last prophet whom Allaah sent, and he
    was not sent to a particular people or a particular time. He was sent to all of
    mankind until the end of the world.

Allaah said in the Qur’aan:

```
يعلﹶمونﹶ لﹶا الناسِ أﹶكﹾثﹶر ولﹶكِن ونذِيرا بشِيرا لِلناسِ كﹶافَّ ةﹰ إِلَّ ا أﹶرسلﹾناك وما
```
```
“ We have only sent you (Muhammad) as a giver of glad tidings
and a warner to all mankind, but most men do not understand. ”^4
```
Thus, his Book of revelation, the Qur’aan, had to be specially preserved from any
from of change or loss so that it would be available to all the generations of man
until the last day of the world.

3. The Qur’aan was the main miracle which was given to Prophet Muhammad
    (r) to prove that he was a true prophet of God and not an imposter. So, the
    Qur’aan had to be saved to prove to the later generations that Muhammad (r)
    was really the last prophet of God. All of the false prophets who came after
    Prophet Muhammad (r) brought books which they claimed to be revealed
    from Allaah, but none of them have the miraculous ability to be memorized by
    thousands, nor have they improved on the message in the Qur’aan.

The significance of the Qur’aan’s preservation is that Islaam has been kept in its
original purity because of it. Man can always return to the sources of Islaam no
matter what people may have added or forgotten in time. All of the essential
principles of Islaam are to be found in the Qur’aan. Consequently, the
preservation of the Qur’aan meant the preservation of Islaam in its final form. The
loss of the Gospel of Jesus means that Christians can never return to the true
teachings of Prophet Jesus except by accepting Islaam. Similarly, the original

(^4) Soorah Saba (34):28.


Torah was lost when Prophet Soloman’s Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by
the Babylonians. Thus, the Jews can not return to the pure teachings of Prophet
Moses except by following Islaam.

It is only in Islaam that the pure teachings of the prophets have been preserved
without any change. That is why Allaah said in the Qur’aan,

###### لإِسلاماﹾ اللَّ هِ عِند الدين إِنَّ

```
“ Verily the only acceptable religion to Allaah is Islaam. ”^5
```
(^5) Soorah Aal ‘Imraan, (3):19.


```
2.2 MAKKAN AND MADEENAN REVELATIONS
```
The Qur’aan was revealed in sections to Prophet Muhammad (r) from the
beginning of his prophethood until shortly before his death. Thus, the Qur’aan
came down continuously over a period of twenty-three years.

Many sections of the Qur’aan were generally revealed to solve the problems
which existed among the Muslim communities in both Makkah and Madeenah.
Since the problems and needs of Makkah were different from those of Madeenah,
the revelations of Makkah and Madeenah have special characteristics of their
own.

It is important to know the difference between the revelations of Makkah and
Madeenah if the Qur’aan itself is to be clearly understood. Because of the great
importance of the Qur’aan to Islaam, Muslim scholars from the time of the
Sahaabah have devoted much time and effort in this area of study.

THE FEATURES OF MAKKAN REVELATIONS

Makkan revelations are defined as all verses and chapters of the Qur’aan which
were brought by Jibreel to the Prophet (r) before the Hijrah^1 (622 C.E.). This
includes verses which were revealed in Taa‘if as well as those revealed in other
areas outside of Makkah. These revelations represent the first stage of the Islamic
movement in which its fundamentals were established.

1. Tawheed :

When Islaam was first presented to the people of Makkah, they were in a state of
disbelief. Most of them believed in Allaah, but they had put between themselves
and Allaah many intermediaries. They made idols to represent these
intermediaries and worshipped them instead of Allaah. Thus, the early
revelations taught the people about Allaah’s unity and power over all things.
They told the people that Allaah was without parents, offspring or any partner

1 The emigration of the Prophet (r) to Madinah.


who shared His powers. They also pointed out that idols could neither bring good
nor hold back evil. And they questioned the logic of worshipping things which
could not even see or hear.

2. Salaah :

After the first verses of revelation came informing the Prophet (r) that he had
been chosen for prophethood, Allaah sent Jibreel to teach him the correct method
of prayer. This was necessary because the correct method of prayer could not be
arrived at by logical reasoning. Therefore, even the Prophet (r) himself had to be
taught the correct method of worshipping Allaah. Thus, the early verses called
upon the Prophet (r) and his early band of followers to make their Salaah
regularly.

Since the Makkans were in the habit of worshipping idols in the belief that these
home-made gods would carry their prayers to Allaah for them, the early verses
were also aimed at clarifying this misconception. The verses taught that Salaah
should only be made for and to Allaah, as He is the only one who can answer
them.

Great stress was placed on Salaah because of its relationship to Tawheed. Correct
Salaah directed to Allaah alone is the most basic way of putting Tawheed into
practice.

3. The Unseen :

Since there was no way that human beings could possibly come to know about the
unseen world, the early verses taught them about its wonders, its mysteries, and
its horrors. The verses described Paradise and its pleasures in order to encourage
the believers to continue to do good deeds and to assure them of a reward. They
also described the Hell -fire and its torments in order to encourage the believers to
strive to avoid evil deeds. Descriptions of the fire and its inhabitants also
reassured the believers that those who do wrong in this life will not escape
Allaah’s punishment. Such descriptions were also aimed at scaring the
disbelievers into reconsidering their position before it became too late. Some of
the verses also reasoned with those who could not accept the resurrection by
giving them examples from nature, such as rain falling on dead earth bringing it
back to life.


```
“ And it is Allaah who sends the winds sturring the clouds and We
drive them to the earth after its death. Likewise (will be) the
Resurrection. ” Soorah Faatir (35) : 9
```
Others pointed out logically that the recreation of life would be easier than its
creation, although it is all the same to Allaah.

```
“ And it is He who originates the creation, then recreates it (after it
has perished) which is easier for Him.... ” Soorah ar-Room (30) : 27
```
4. Allaah **’** s Existence :

There were some individuals among the Makkans who were in doubt about
Allaah’s very existence. Thus, some of the early verses presented logical
arguments proving Allaah’s existence. Sometimes proofs were taken from nature
and the creatures common to the society. Allaah asked the Makkans,

```
“ Why didn ’ t they look at the camels and how they were created, and
the sky and how it was raised, and the mountains and how they are
firmly fixed and the earth and how it was spread out? ” Soorah al-
Ghaashiyah (88) : 17-20
```
At other times straight logic was used. Allaah asked them if they were created
from nothing or if they created themselves:

```
“ Were they created of nothing, or were they themselves the
creators? ” Soorah at-Toor (52) : 35
```
The answer had to be one or the other. Since they knew they had not created
themselves, they had to realize that they were created. Even if they said that they
came from their parents and their parents came from their parents and so on. The
numbers eventually decrease to one who came from nothing. Thus, Allaah, the
Creator, has to be accepted for our existence to make sense.

5. Challenges :


In order to prove to the Quraysh that the Qur’aan was from Allaah and that
Muhammad (r) was a prophet of Allaah, some of the Makkan verses challenged
the Arabs to imitate the Qur’aan. Many of the chapters began with individual
letters like “Alif, Laam and Meem, _” “_ Saad, _”_ or _“_ Noon _”_ in order to tease the
Makkans with the same letters of the alphabet that they made their flowery
speeches and poetry with. Allaah made the Qur’aan with the same letters, but
they just could not imitate it. Since the Arabs were unable to produce even a
chapter resembling the smallest chapter of the Qur’aan, the miraculous nature of
the Qur’aan and its divine origin were clearly proven to the people at that time.
However, many of them preferred to look at the Qur’aan as a magical spell, and
the Prophet (r) as a master magician.

6. The People of Old :

The Makkan verses often mentioned historical examples of earlier civilizations,
like the ‘Aad and the Thamood. They were mentioned in order to warn those who
had rejected the message of Islaam. The verses spoke about the wonders of the
ancient civilizations. They listed the many blessings which Allaah had bestowed
on the peoples of those civilizations. Then they recounted how the people
disobeyed Allaah and denied His blessings, and how Allaah’s punishment caught
them when they were totally unaware of what could become of them if Allaah so
willed. These examples were quite familiar to the Arabs because the ruins of such
civilizations could still be seen. For example, the stone tombs of Madaa _‘_ in
Saalih were directly on the trade route to Syria.

7. Eemaan :

Very few laws were revealed in the Makkan verses. Instead, the verses
concentrated on principles which would build the Eemaan (faith) of the early
Muslims. These verses spoke of the importance of fearing Allaah and being
aware of His presence and knowledge of all things. They were often filled with
advice about being patient, perseverant, truthful and trustworthy, in order to build
the moral spiritual character of the early Muslims who were in a minority and
under a lot of pressure from Makkan society.

8. Short Verses :


The Makkan Soorahs usually had short verses, catchy rhymes, and a very strong
rhythm. These qualities were meant to catch the attention of listeners who were
basically opposed to the message of Islaam. The verses had to be short because
the audience would not be willing to listen to long, drawn-out statements. As
soon as they heard any of the Qur’aan, they would stick their fingers in their ears
and turn away. Thus, the verses often had to strike home immediately. They
often resembled the chants of the oracles and fortunetellers, but their meanings
were very clear, whereas the chants were mostly obscure and vague. For
example, the oracle Zabraa warned her people about a disaster which would soon
strike them as follows :

```
By the fluttering wind, and the falling night.
By the shining morn, and the piercing star.
By the rain-laden clouds,
Verily, the trees of the valley are really deceptive,
and teeth gnash until twisted.
Verily, the boulders of the mountain warn of mourning,
that you won’t find any escape from.
The Fortuneteller Zabraa
```
THE FEATURES OF MADEENAN REVELATIONS

Madeenan revelations are all those verses and chapters of the Qur’aan which were
revealed after the Hijrah. This includes verses which were revealed during the
battles, as well as those revealed in Makkah and Minaa during and after the
Farewell Pilgrimage. All of these verses are considered Madeenan because they
represent the revelations of the second stage of the Islamic movement in which
the consolidation of the Islamic state took place.

The following are some of the main characteristics of Madeenan verses :

1. Laws :


Once Madeenah had become the new center of the Islamic movement, the Islamic
state was born. The Prophet (r) became ruler over the Muslims of Madeenah, as
well as the Jews and the Arab idol worshippers who lived there. A constitution
was drawn up and a system of justice was established. Thus, the verses during the
Madeenan stage contained the many social, economic and spiritual laws which
were necessary for the organization and development of an Islamic state. It was
during this period that the last three pillars of Islaam, Zakaah, Sawm and Hajj,
were revealed. Likewise, it was during this period that drinking alcohol, eating
swine and gambling were all forbidden.

2. People of the Book :

In Madeenah, Muslims came in contact with the Jews for the first time. In order
to try to shake the beliefs of the Muslims, the Jews used to ask the Prophet (r)
various questions about Allaah, the earlier prophets, and the unseen. They asked
questions about the origin of the soul and what it was made of. Thus, a number of
Madeenan verses represented answers to the many questions raised by the Jews.
The Muslims of Madeenah also came in contact with the Christians on a larger
scale. As a result of that, we find a number of Madeenan verses clarifying
Christian misconceptions about Prophet Jesus and Allaah. They pointed out that
Jesus’ birth was not greater than that of Aadam who had neither father nor
mother.

```
“ Surely the likeness of Jesus in Allaah ’ s sight is as the likeness of
Aadam.. He created him from dust, then said to him, ‘ Be! ’ And he
was. ”
Soorah Aal - ‘Imraan (3) : 59
```
They also stressed that the miracles of Jesus, such as bringing the dead back to
life, were only by Allaah’s permission. Thus, Jesus was not a god nor the son of
Allaah, and Allaah was not the third of three.

3. The Munaafiqoon :

For the first time since the beginning of the final message we find people entering
Islaam, yet not believing in it. In Makkah, Muslims were oppressed and attacked,
so no one would enter Islaam unless he truly believed. On the other hand, the
Muslims of Madeenah were strong and they ruled the city. Thus, we find some


people entering Islaam in order to benefit from its strength and to oppose it from
within. ‘Abdullaah ibn Ubayy ibn Salool was about to be crowned King of
Madeenah when the Prophet (r) arrived. The Prophet (r) was made the ruler of
Madeenah and Ibn Salool’s hopes were ruined. Since the Muslims were strong
and he could not openly oppose them, he accepted Islaam and worked against it
from within. He eventually became the head of the Munaafiqoon (hypocrites).
Thus, the verses of the Madeenan stage warned the Muslims about the dangers of
the hypocrites and taught them how to deal effectively with them.

4. Jihaad :

The right of fight against the enemy was given for the first time in al-Madeenah.
During the Makkan period, Muslims were forbidden to fight back. This was for
two basic reasons : (1) The Muslims were a minority and could easily be
completely wiped out, and (2) only the strong could survive this test. The
Makkan period prepared the foundation of the Islamic movement to come. It was
during the Madeenan stage that a series of battles were fought against the forces
of disbelief until finally Makkah was conquered and the whole of the Arabian
peninsula came under the rule of Islaam. Thus, a number of the Madeenan verses
taught Muslims the Islamic principles of war. For example, they taught how to
deal with prisoners of war and they forbade retreat during an attack except as a
trick to trap the enemy. They also encouraged the Muslims to prepare themselves
with the best weapons and battle gear they could find.

5. Long Verses :

The Madeenan verses tended to be longer than those of Makkah. In fact, there are
a number of Madeenan verses which are longer than whole soorahs of the
Makkan period. The longest verse of the Qur’aan is the verse on loans^2 in the
Madeenan Soorah, al-Baqarah. This verse contains approximately 143 words.
The shortest Soorah of the Qur’aan is the Makkan Soorah al-Kawthar,^3 which
contains a total of only 11 separate words in its three short verses. The need to
catch the attention of unwilling listeners was no longer there because Islaam had
become strong and its followers were many. Thus, the audience at this stage was
quite willing to listen attentively to longer verses teaching the vital laws of Islam.

2 Soorah al-Baqarah (2) : 292.
3 The Soorah 102.


6. Order of the Soorahs :

Although all of the Makkan verses were revealed during the same period, they
were neither memorized nor written in the same order in which they were
revealed. Verses from various Soorahs were revealed at once. Whenever single
verses were revealed at once. Whenever single verses were revealed, the Prophet
(r) would tell his scribes to write it in the Soorah to which it belonged. If a new
Soorah was revealed, he would recite the Soorah in the order it was to be
recorded. Once the Madeenan verses and Soorahs began to be revealed, the
Prophet (r) would tell his companions to place them before or after certain
Makkan Soorahs and verses. Thus, when the revelation of the Qur’aan was
complete, Makkan verses could be found within Madeenan Soorahs and
Madeenan verses within Makkan Soorahs. The Prophet (r) reordered the verses
and Soorahs of the Qur’aan according to Allaah’s command. the reason for that
was that the verses were revealed according to the needs of a developing
community, whereas the order for reading purposes needed to be varied so as not
to make the Qur’aan seem one-sided in its presentation. The mixture of verses
and chapters from the two stages gives the reader a more balanced picture of the
message of Islaam.

THE IMPORTANCE

There are a number of reasons why a distinction needs to be made between
Makkan and Madeenan Soorahs and verses. The following are only the three
most important reasons :

1. Fiqh (Islamic Law)

The various laws of Islaam were revealed over a period of twenty-three years.
Some laws canceled earlier laws and other laws were revealed bit by bit. Thus, it
is necessary to know at which point in time the various laws were revealed in
order to apply them properly. The laws of the later Madeenan period sometimes
took the place of earlier laws. For example, alcohol was made forbidden in
gradual stages. The first law concerning alcohol was simply a warning of its
dangers. Allaah said,

```
“ And, when they ask you about Khamr (alcohol) and Maysir
(gambling), tell them that they contain benefit for some people, but
the sin is greater than the benefit. ” Soorah al-Baqarah (2):20
```

The second law which was revealed warned Muslims away from Salaah when
they were intoxicated (drunk). Allaah said,

```
“ Do not come to Salaah when you are intoxicated (drunk), until you
know what you are saying. ”
Soorah an-Nisaa’ (4) : 43
```
The third law, however, was a complete prohibition of even coming near any
form of alcohol. Allaah said,

```
“ Verily, alcohol, gambling and sacrificial altars are filth, as a
result of Shaytaan ’ s work, so stay away from them. ” Soorah al-
Maa‘idah (5) : 93
```
If one was unaware of the order in which these verses were revealed, he or she
may mistakenly think that drinking alcohol is allowed as long as one doesn’t get
drunk and come to Salaah. Or, it might be thought that benefitting from the sale
of alcohol is permitted.

2. Da **‘** wah

By understanding the order in which the verses of the Qur’aan were revealed, one
can learn the best method of teaching Islaam. For example, the Qur’aan taught the
believers not to curse or make fun of the idols of the disbelievers in order not to
drive them away and in order that they do not curse Allaah out of ignorance.
Instead they were told to reason with the disbelievers and show them logically
why the worship of idols was incorrect. Allaah said,

```
“ Are you worshipping besides Allaah other gods which cannot
benefit you at all nor harm you? ”
Soorah al-Anbiyaa‘ (21) : 66
```
3. Seerah


Many of the important events in the Prophet’s life have been recorded in various
of the Qur’aan. Thus, by knowing the order in which the verses were revealed, it
is possible to piece together a large portion of the biography of the Prophet (r).


```
2.3 QUR’AAN: THE UNIQUE BOOK
```
The word Qur’aan, a verbal noun, is equivalent in meaning to Qiraa _’_ ah, as both
come from the verb Qara _’_ a, which means to read. That is, Qur’aan literally
means a reading or a recitation. However, the term Qur’aan has been historically
used specifically to refer to the book which was revealed by Allaah to the Prophet
Muhammad (r) through the angel Jibreel. The term Qur’aan is mentioned in a
number of places throughout the book in reference to itself. For example,

```
“ Verily, this Qur ’ aan guides (man) to that which is most just. ”
(Soorah al-Israa’ (17:9)
```
The name Qur’aan is used to refer to both the Qur’aan as a whole as in the
previously quoted verse, as well as to each verse or group of verses:

```
“ And if the Qur ’ aan is recited, you should listen to it quietly (and be
silent). ”
(Soorah al-Aa‘raaf (7:38)
```
The Book has also been referred to by other names, for example, the Furqaan
(The Distinction),

```
“ Blessed is He Who revealed the Furqaan to His slave in order that
he may be a warner to all worlds. ” (Soorah al-Furqaan (25):1)
```
And, the Dhikr (The Reminder),

```
“ Verily, We revealed the Dhikr and verily, We will preserve it. ”
(Soorah al-Hijr (15:9)
```

The Qur’aan itself could be defined as Allaah’s words which were revealed in
Arabic in a rhythmical form to the Prophet Muhammad (r). Its recitation is used
in acts of worship and even its smallest chapter (Soorah) is of a miraculous
nature.

The Prophet’s divinely inspired statements which were recorded by his followers
are generally referred to as Hadeeths.^1 For example, the Prophet’s companion
(Sahaabee), ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, reported that he once said, _“_ Verily, deeds are
(judged) by their intentions. _”_^2 However, in some of his statements, the Prophet
(r) attributed what he said to Allaah. For example, another Sahaabee, Abu
Hurayrah, reported that the Prophet (r) said, _“_ Allaah, Most High, said, _‘_ I am as
My slave thinks of Me, and I am with him when he remembers Me. So if he
remembers Me to himself, I will remember him to Myself, and if he remembers Me
in a group, I will remember him in a better group. _’”_^3 In order to distinguish this
type of hadeeth from the previous type, it is referred to as Hadeeth Qudsee (Holy
Hadeeth) and the former referred to as Hadeeth Nabawee (Prophetic Hadeeth).

The Qur’aan, however, is not considered the same as Hadeeth Qudsee for a
number of reasons. First, the Qur’aan is from Allaah, both in its wording and in
its meaning, while in the case of Hadeeth Qudsee, its meaning is from Allaah, but
its wording was from the prophet (r). Second, Allaah challenged the Arabs and
mankind in general to produce even one chapter equivalent to one of the
Qur’aan’s chapters and their inability to do so proves its miraculous nature. This
is not so in the case of Hadeeth Qudsee. Third, the recitation of the Qur’aan is
used in Salaah and is itself considered a form of worship. The Prophet (r) said,
_“_ Whoever reads a letter from Allaah Most High _’_ s book will get a good deed
(recorded for him) and each good deed is worth ten times its value. And, I am not
only saying that Alif Laam Meem is a letter, but I am saying that Alif is a letter,
Laam is a letter, and Meem is a letter. _”_^4 Whereas the recitation of Hadeeth
Qudsee carries none of these properties.

The Mode of Presentation

Collected by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), vol.4, p.1408, no.6471.
4 Reported by Ibn Mas‘ood and collected by at-Tirmithee.


The Qur’aan is God’s final communication of His divine will to human kind. It is
the Creator speaking to human beings and it takes the form of human
conversation. As humans change subjects randomly during conversation, the
topics of the Qur’aan change in a seemingly random way. Consequently, the
format of the Qur’aan is quite unique among books. As a whole is not a book in
the usual sense of the word wherein there is an introduction and explanation of the
subject followed by a conclusion. Neither is it restricted to only a presentation of
historical events, problems of philosophy, facts of science, or social laws, though
all may be found woven together in it without any apparent connection and links.
Subjects are introduced without background information, historical events are not
presented in chronological order, new topics sometimes crop up in the middle of
another for no apparent reason, and the speaker and those spoken to change
direction without the slightest forewarning. The reader who is unaware of the
Qur’aan’s uniqueness if often puzzled when he finds it contrary to his
understanding of a book, especially a “religious” book. Hence, the Qur’aan may
seem disorganized and haphazard to him. However, to those who understand its
subject matter, aim, and its central theme, the Qur’aan is exactly the opposite.

The Main Theme

The subject matter of the Qur’aan is essentially man: man in relation to his Lord
and Creator, Allaah, man in relation to himself, and man in relation to the rest of
creation. The main theme that runs throughout the Qur’aan is that Allaah alone
deserves worship and that man should submit to Allaah’s laws in his personal life
and in his relationship with creation in general. Or, in other words, the main
theme is a call to the belief in Allaah and the doing of righteous deeds as defined
by Allaah.

If the reader keeps in mind these basic facts, he will find that from the beginning
to the end, the Qur’aan’s basic topics are all closely connected to its main theme
and that the whole book is a well-reasoned and cohesive argument for its theme.
The Qur’aan keeps the same object in view, whether it is describing the creation
of man and the universe, or events from human history. Since the aim of the
Qur’aan is to guide man, it states or discusses things only to the extent relevant to
this aim and leaves out unnecessary and irrelevant details. It also repeats its main
theme over and over again in the presentation of each new topic.

The following four principles should be kept in mind by the new reader of the
Qur’aan if he or she is to avoid unnecessary confusion and disorientation:

“The book is the only one of its type in the world.”

“Pre-conceived notions of a book are only a hindrance to the understanding
of the Qur’aan.”^5
```
THE MIRACLE OF THE QUR **’** AAN

The Miracles Given to the Prophets

Man has a natural distaste towards submitting to another human being unless he is
forced to by physical strength or his mental superiority, or if he is shown feats far
beyond the human. In the first two cases he yields reluctantly, while in the third
he yields because of his belief in a higher force or power defying all human
comparison. Because of this, Allaah favored His messengers not only with
revelation, but also with miracles, clearly proving to the people the divine origin
and truthfulness of their messages. The inability of the people to imitate the
miracles of the prophets made them willingly bear witness to Allaah’s unity and
obey the commandments of the prophets.

Due to the difficulties involved in communication and transportation, the early
prophets were sent only to the people among whom they were raised. Therefore,
the miracles which they brought were particularly suited to the areas of
knowledge in which their people excelled in order for the miracles to have the
maximum effect on them. For example, Prophet Moosaa (Moses) (r) was raised
up among the Egyptians who were noted for their mastery of the occult arts,
sorcery, and magic. Allaah gave him the miracle of being able to place in hand in
his cloak and his hand. When sorcerers and magicians were gathered to challenge
Prophet Moosaa (r), the staffs which they cast appeared to the audience as

5 Maududi, Abu Ala; The Meaning of the Qur _’_ aan (Islamic Pub Ltd.), Pakistan, Second Edition,
1971, vol.2, p.7.


snakes. Then Allaah turned Prophet Moosaa’s staff into a real snake which
swallowed up the optical illusions of his opponents. That defeat was sufficient
proof for the magicians and sorcerers who knew that no man could change the
nature of a stick as Moosaa apparently had done. They fell on their faces in
submission and sincere belief in the god of Moosaa, in spite of the threats on their
lives uttered by their master, the Pharaoh. Another example is that of Prophet
‘Eesaa (Jesus) , who was chosen by Allaah from among the Jews. The Jews were
especially noted for their exceptional abilities in the field of medicine. Jewish
doctors were highly respected and revered for their seemingly magical ability to
mend bones, heal wounds, and cure the sick. Thus, Allaah favored Prophet

‘Eesaa (r) with the miraculous ability to make the blind see, the lame walk, and
bring the dead back to life. These abilities were clearly beyond those of the
Jewish doctors of that day and they knew well that no mere man could do feats.

Yet, Allaah gave Prophet ‘Eesaa (r) an even more dazzling miracle: he was able
to mold birds out of clay, breathe on them, and they would fly away. Since the
Prophet Muhammad (r) was to be the last of the prophets, sent not only to a
particular people, but to all of mankind, Allaah gave him a miracle which not only
amazed the people among whom he was raised, but which would challenge and
amaze the human mind until the last days of this world. Prophet Muhammad (r),
like the other prophets before him, was given a number of other miracles whose
effects were basically limited to the people of his time; for example, the splitting
of the moon at his tribe’s request for a sign, the outpouring of water from his
hands on one occasion when he and his companions were short of water, and the
phenomenon of pebbles and rocks giving Salaams to him (greeting him with the
phrase, _“_ Assalaamu _‘_ alaykum, _’_ which means “Peace be on you”), just to mention a
few. However, the miracle of Prophet Muhammad (r) which was consistent with
Allaah’s aid to the prophets before him was a literary miracle.

The Arabs had very little in the way of unique skills or accumulated knowledge,
but they took great pride in their oratory and literary skills. Yearly contests were
held in fairs like that of _‘_ Ukkaadh, in which many lines of speeches and poetry
were recited from memory. Their language had reached development and
eloquence and was considered the highest quality human being could possess. In
fact, the ten most famous poems were so revered that they were etched in gold
and hung in the Ka _‘_ bah for “Alif Laam Meem _”_ or _“_ Qaaf _”_ or _“_ Noon, _’_
tantalizing the Arab mind, as if they say “from these letters which you combine to
form your daily conversations, as well as your great works of poetry and prose, is
formed a book whose shortest chapter does not exceed three lines, yet you cannot
imitate it no matter how hard you try!” The Prophet (r) stated, _“_ All Prophets
were given something which would cause people to believe in them. The thing


which I was given is none other than a revelation (the Qur _’_ aan) which Allaah
revealed to me. So I hope that I will have the most followers of them on the Day of
Judgement. _”_^6

The Challenge

The Qur’aan is not only unique in the way in which it presents its subject matter,
but it is also unique in that it is a miracle itself.

By the term miracle we mean the performance of supernatural or extraordinary
even which cannot be duplicated. It has been documented that Prophet
Muhammad (r) challenged the Arabs to produce a literary work of a similar
caliber as the Qur’aan, but they were unable to do so, in spite of their well-known
eloquence and literary powers. The challenge to reproduce the Qur’aan was
presented to the Arabs and mankind in three stages:

1. The Whole Qur’aan: In the Qur’aan, Allaah commanded the Prophet (r)
to challenge all of creation to create a book of the stature of the Qur’aan,

```
“ Say: even if all of mankind and the Jinn gather together to produce
something like this Qur ’ aan, they will not be able to do so in spite of
their cooperation with each other. ”
(Soorah al-Israa’ (17:88)^7
```
2. Ten Soorahs (Chapters): Shortly after the previous challenge, Allaah
again commanded His Messenger (r) to dare those of the Arabs who claimed that
the Qur’aan was Muhammad’s invention to produce ten chapters like any ten of
the Soorahs of the Qur’aan:

(^6) Reported by Abu Hurayrah and collected by al-Bukhaaree ( Sahih al-Bukhari (Arabic-English),
vol.6, p.474, no.504) and Muslim.
(^7) Soorah al-Israa’ was the 50th Soorah revealed.


```
“ Or if they say that he invented it, say (to them), ‘ Bring ten invented
Soorahs like it. And you may call on whosoever besides Allaah that
you are able (to help you) if you are (really) truthful (in what you
say). If they do not answer your (request for help), then know all of
you that it was only revealed by Allaah ’ s knowledge. ’”
(Soorah Hood (11:13-14)^8
```
3. One Soorah: In the very next Soorah, which was revealed, Allaah brought
the challenge to its utmost peak by asking those who denied its divine origin to
imitate even a single Soorah, the shortest of which consisted of only three
verses, Soorah al-Kawthar.

```
“ Or if they say that he has invented it, say (to them), ‘ Bring a single
Soorah like it. ’”
(Soorah Yoonus (10:38)^9
```
This final challenge was repeated some time later as follows:

```
“ And if you all are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our
servant, bring a single Soorah like it. ” (Soorah al-Baqarah (2:23)^10
```
These challenges were not just empty words with no one caring to prove them
wrong. Prophet Muhammad’s (r) call to monotheism, to the abolition of idolatry
in all of its forms, and to the equality of slaves and their masters threatened the
whole socio-economic framework of Makkan society in general, and the position
of the ruling Qurayshee tribe, from which Prophet Muhammad (r) came, in
particular. Makkah, the trading center of Arabia, as well as its spiritual center,
desperately wanted to stop the spread of Islaam. The challenge was straight
forward, all that the Prophet’s opponents had to do to crush the movement was to

make up a single Soorah like any one of those which the Prophet (r) and his
followers were reciting to the people. A number of Qurayshee orators and poets

(^8) Sooraah Hood was the 52nd Soorah revealed.
(^9) Soorah Yoonus was the 53d Soorah revealed.
(^10) Soorah al-Baqarah was the 87th Soorah revealed.


tried to imitate the Qur’aan, but of course they failed. Unable to match the
Prophet’s challenge, the Quraysh looked for other methods of crushing the
Islamic movements. They resorted to offering Prophet Muhammad vast amounts
of wealth, the position of king over them, and the most noble and beautiful of
their women in exchange for his promise to stop inviting people to Islaam.
However, his only reply was that even if the sun were placed in his right hand and
the moon in his left, he would not cease to call others to Islaam.^11 The Quraysh
also resorted to torturing their slaves and relatives who had embraced Islaam in a
vain attempt to cause them to revert to paganism. Later they organized an
economic boycott against the Prophet (r) and the members of his clan, Banoo
Hashim, in an attempt to starve them into submission. But even this plan
eventually failed. Finally, the plotted to kill him in his home by sending armed
young men from each of the clans of Quraysh in order that the guilt of his murder

be shared by all and revenge by the Prophet’s (r) clan be made impossible.
However, Allaah enabled the Prophet (r) and his followers to flee Makkah and
join a new band of converts who had arisen among the tribes of a city to the north
called Yathrib.

Islaam spread rapidly through the calms of Yathrib, and within a year Muslims
became the city’s majority. The Prophet (r) was then made the ruler and the
name of the city was changed to Madeenah. Over the next eight years the clans of
Makkah and its neighboring lands mounted a series of unsuccessful battle
campaigns against the emerging Muslim state in Madeenah, ending with the
Muslim invasion of Makkah itself. All of this bloodshed could have been avoided
if only the Quraysh and their allies had been able to produce a mere three lines of
poetry or flowing prose similar to the shortest Soorah of the Qur’aan. Hence,
there can be no doubt about the inimitability of the Qur’aan’s literary style, about
the miracle of its rhyme and the extraordinary nature of its rhythm.

It has been suggested that the inimitability of the Qur’aan is not necessarily
unique, for great poets like Shakespeare, Chaucer, or great poets in any language
tend to have distinctly different styles which set them apart from their
contemporaries. However, if some leading poets of today were to make an in-

careful study. Even the greatest poets could be imitated, no matter how unique
their style was, just as the famous painters have been imitated.^12

The Qur’aan, however, is far above this level, as attempts to forge chapters have
been made throughout the ages, yet none have withstood close scrutiny. And, as
was mentioned before, the incentive to imitate the Qur’aan existed during the time
of its revelation more so than at any other time at a time when literary skills were
at their peak, yet there was no successful attempt.

(^12) In fact, some English scholars consider much of what has been attributed to Shakespeare to
have been written by his contemporary, Christopher Marlowe.

2.4 TAFSEER METHODOLOGY
```
he Qur’aan, God’s final book of revelation to man, represents the primary
source of the principles which constitute the way of life known as Islaam.
The passages of the Qur’aan contain advice and guidance in the form of
laws, parables, stories, and arguments for those who choose to believe in God and
the Day of Judgment. Hence, a believer’s success and happiness in this life and
the next largely depend on his understanding, internalization, and application of
the concepts contained in the Book. However, the depth of comprehension of the
Qur’aan’s meanings will vary from individual to individual due to natural
differences in intelligence. This variation existed even among the sahaabah
(companions of the Prophet (r), in spite of the Qur’aan’s clarity of expression
and its revelation in seven different dialects. Moreover, Allaah, the Most Wise,
chose to place generalities in the Qur’aan, some of which He later explained in its
other verses, while some he explained only to the Prophet (r). The Prophet (r)
knew and understood the Qur’aan completely because Allaah had chosen him as
its vehicle and explained it all to him. Hence, Allaah said in one verse.

**بيانه علﹶينا إِنَّ ثﹸم** 4 **قﹸرلاﹶنه بِعت فا قﹶرأﹾناه فﹶإِذﹶا** 4 **وقﹸرآنه جمعه علﹶينا إِنَّ**

```
“ Verily, collecting the Qur ’ aan (for you) and reciting it (to you) is
Our responsibility, so when We read it to you, listen to it. Then it is
upon Us to explain it. ”^1
```
Therefore, it was the Prophet’s job to explain the Qur’aan to his followers by his
actions, as well as his statements. Allaah stated this in the Qur’aan:

**إِلﹶيهِم نزلﹶ ما لِلناسِ لِتبين الذِّ كﹾر إِلﹶيك وأﹶنزلﹾنا**

```
“ We have revealed the Reminder (Qur ’ aan) to you (O Muhammad)
so that you may explain to people what has been revealed to them. ”^2
```
(^1) Soorah al-Qiyaamah (75):17-9.
(^2) Soorah an-Nahl (16):44.

# T


Consequently, the sahaabah all turned to the Prophet (r) whenever possible
during his lifetime for the tafseer (explanation, understanding, interpretation) of
the Qur’aan. For example, Ibn Mas‘ood related that when the following verse was
revealed:

**مهتدونﹶ وهم الﹾأﹶمن لﹶهم أﹸولﹶئِك بِظﹸلﹾمٍ إِيمانهم يلﹾبِسوا ولﹶم آمنوا َالَّ ذِين**

```
“ Those who believe and do not obscure their faith with transgression
(thulm), for them there is security, and they are rightly guided, ”^3
```
some of the companions became distressed, because the general linguistic
meaning of thulm covers any kind of wrong, major or minor, and none of them
were free from error. However, when they approached the Prophet (r) about it, he
replied,

###### إِنَّ بِاللَّ هِ تشرِك لاﹶ بني يا لاِبنِهِ لﹸقﹾمانﹸ قﹶالﹶ كﹶما هو إِنما تظﹸنونﹶ كﹶما هو لﹶيس

**عظِيم لﹶظﹸلﹾم الشرك**

```
“ It is not as you all think. It is no more than what Luqmaan said to his
son, ‘ Verily, shirk (associating partners with God) is the greatest form
of thulm. ’^4 ”^5
```
Thus the Prophet (r) clarified for them that the broader meaning of thulm was not
intended in the first verse; rather it was used to refer to shirk.

In this incident, the Prophet (r) explained the Qur’aan by the Qur’aan,
demonstrating the first step in the divinely ordained method of understanding and
interpretation of the Qur’aan that was established for all generations of Muslims
until the Day of Resurrection. After the Prophet’s death, the sahaabah turned to
those among themselves who were more gifted in understanding the Qur’aan and
who had been able to spend more time with the Prophet (r) for interpretation and
explanation of the Qur’aan.

Tafseer and Ta **_’_** weel

(^3) Soorah al-An _‘_ aam (6):82.
(^4) Soorah Luqmaan (31):3.
(^5) Sahih Muslim, vol. 1, p. 72, no. 226.


The words tafseer and ta _’_ weel were considered synonyms by the early
generations of Muslims; however, in the centuries following the era of the
taabi _‘_ oon and their students (9th and 10th centuries CE/3rd and 4th centuries
AH), the term ta _’_ weel took on a new meaning with new and dangerous
implications. Consequently, it is necessary for us to look at these terms in their
original context, as well as their later usage.

The word tafseer, which comes from the verb fassara, literally means an
explanation or an exposition, as in the verse,

###### تفﹾسِيرا بِالﹾحقِّوأﹶحسن جِئﹾناﹶك إِلاَّ بِمثﹶلٍ يأﹾتونك ولا

```
“ For any parable they bring, We will bring you the truth and a
better explanation (tafseeran). ”^6
```
However, in Qur’aanic sciences, this term is defined as a branch of knowledge by
which the Qur’aan is understood, its meanings explained, and its points of law
and wisdom derived.^7

On the other hand, the word ta _’_ weel, which comes from the verb awwala,
literally means interpretation. When the word ta _’_ weel is used in the context of a
command, it means its execution or implementation, as in the hadeeth reported
by ‘Aa’ishah in which she said, “Allaah’s Messenger (r) used to implement
(yata _’_ awwal) the Qur’aan by saying in rukoo _‘_ (bowing) and sujood (prostration)
[during salaah],

```
( لِي اغﹾفِر اللَّ هم وبِحمدِك ربنﹶا اللَّ هم انﹶكسبح )
```
‘Glory be to You, O Allaah, our Lord, and Praised are You. O Allaah, forgive
me _’_. _”_^8

She was referring to the Prophet’s execution of Allaah’s command in the verse,

**با توا كﹶانﹶ,واستغفِره رّبِك بِحمدِ فﹶسبِح**

(^6) Soorah al-Furqaan (25):33.
(^7) Al-Itqaan fee _‘_ Uloom al-Qur _’_ aan, vol. 2, p. 174.
(^8) Collected by al-Bukhaaree (Sahih Al-Bukhari, vol. 1, p. 434, no. 781) and Muslim (Sahih
Muslim, vol. 1, pp. 255-6, no. 981).


```
“ Glorify Your Lord and ask His forgiveness, for verily, He is Oft-
Forgiving. ” 9
```
When ta _’_ weel is used in reference to news or information, it refers to its
occurrence, as in the verse,

**ينظﹸرونﹶ هلﹾ** 4 **يؤمِنونﹶ لِقﹶومٍ ورحمةﹰ هدى عِلﹾمٍ علﹶى فﹶصلﹾناه بِكِتابٍ جِئﹾناهم ولﹶقﹶد**

**تأﹾوِيلﹶه إِلاَّ**

```
“ Verily, We have brought them a book of knowledge — and explained
it in detail — a guide and a mercy for the Believers. Are they only
waiting for the occurrence (ta ’ weelahu) (of what is in the Book)? ”^10
```
That is, Allaah ridicules those who do not accept revelation by asking them if they
are foolishly awaiting the occurrence of the final hour and its signs, the Judgment,
Paradise, and the Hellfire, when it will be too late.

However, when the word ta _’_ weel is used in reference to recorded speech,
it refers to its explanation or interpretation, as in the verse:

**وأﹸخر الﹾكِتابِ أﹸم هن محكﹶمات آيات مِنه الﹾكِتاب علﹶيك أﹶنزلﹶ الَّ ذِي هو**

**وابتِغاءَ الﹾفِتنةِ ابتِغاءَ مِنه تشابه ما فﹶيتبِعونﹶ يغﹲز قﹸلﹸوبِهِم فِي الَّ ذِين فﹶأﹶما متشابِهات**

**تأﹾوِيلِهِ**

```
“ It is He who revealed the Book to you. In it are clear verses which
are the essence of the Book and others which are obscure. As for
those whose hearts are twisted, they follow what is obscure seeking
to sow discord and searching for its interpretation (ta ’ weelahu). ”^11
```
Hence, the early scholars of tafseer used the words tafseer and ta _’_ weel
interchangeably. For example, Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree, in his tafseer, commonly

(^9) Soorah an-Nasr (110):3.
(^10) Soorah al-A _‘_ raaf (7):52-3.
(^11) Soorah Aal _‘_ Imraan (3):7.


introduced each section with the phrase, “The opinion concerning the ta _’_ weel
(explanation) of the statement of the Exalted.”^12

In later centuries, when deviant and heretical explanations abounded, the
term ta _’_ weel was used by the scholars of that time to justify them and give them
an air of legitimacy. They defined ta _’_ weel as the shifting of an expression from its
obvious meaning to one of its likely meanings due to its context;^13 that is, the
interpretation of a passage by other than its obvious meaning for whatever reason
a scholar considered relevant. For example, scholars of this period under
Mu‘tazilee (Rationalist) influence explained away the word ‘hand’ in the
following verse, which refers to an oath taken by the sahaabah:

**أﹶيدِيهِم قفﹶو اللَّ هِ يد**

```
“ Allaah ’ s hand is above their hands. ”^14
```
They interpreted it as being Allaah’s help and support for the simple reason that,
as they put it, Allaah could not possible have a hand. This ‘ta _’_ weel’ was based on
the false premise that the attribution of a hand to Allaah automatically implied
conceptualizing Him in human form. However, in the same way that referring to
Allaah as a living being (al-Hayy) does not in any way make Him humanlike,
because His life is in no way like our life, referring to Allaah’s hand as a real hand
does not make Him humanlike, for his hand is in no way like our hands. It should
be noted that the affirmation by Ahl as-Sunnah wa al-Jamaa _‘_ ah that Allaah has a
real hand does not mean that they understand His hand to be a body part.

```
The Qur’aan is the last book of divine revelation sent to man, and Allaah has
promised to protect it from any distortion or loss. He said in the Qur’aan:
```
**لﹶحافِظﹸونﹶ لﹶه وإِنا الذِّ كﹾر نزلﹾنا نحن إِنا**

```
“ Verily, We have revealed the Reminder (Qur ’ aan) and verily We
will preserve it. ”^15
```
(^12) Lamahaat fee _‘_ Uloom al-Qur _’_ aan, pp.123-4.
(^13) Mabaahith fee _‘_ Uloom al-Qur _’_ aan, p. 326.
(^14) Soorah al-Fat-h (48):10.
(^15) Soorah al-Hijr (15):9.


Its written and recited forms have been preserved without even the slightest

change for over fourteen hundred years, as has been mentioned in previous
chapters. This cannot be said about the Gospel of Prophet Jesus (r), nor the books

of the Old Testament attributed to earlier prophets, nor any other scripture
revealed by Allaah. However, Allaah’s protection of the Qur’aan did not stop
there; He also safeguarded the original meaning. If the protection of the Qur’aan’s
meaning had not taken place, deviants would have turned the Book of Allaah into
a jumble of symbols, riddles and codes open to a multiplicity of interpretations,
and its original meaning would have been lost. Allaah preserved the meaning of
the Qur’aan by explaining some of its generalities within the Qur’aan itself and by
entrusting the tafseer of the remainder to His Messenger, Muhammad ibn
Abdillaah (r)(570-632 CE).

The sahaabah (companions) were taught to seek their understanding of the
Qur’aan first from the Qur’aan itself, then from the explanations and applications
of the Prophet (r) and from their own intimate understanding of the language of
the Qur’aan. After the Prophet’s death, those who entered Islaam as new converts
depended first upon the Qur’aan to explain itself, then they depended on the
sahaabah to explain the Qur’aan to them. The sahaabah would inform their
students among the taabi _‘_ oon of the circumstances in which the verses were
revealed, the interpretation given by the Prophet’s statements and his actions, and
finally they would explain the meanings of some words which may not have been
familiar or which may have had a different meaning to Arabs outside of the
Arabian peninsula. With the passing of the era of the sahaabah, the scholars
among the taabi _‘_ oon shouldered the grave responsibility of conveying the original
meanings of the Qur’aan to the next generation of Muslims exactly as they had
received them. It was the third generation which began the process of gathering
and recording the various narrations of tafseer from the taabi _‘_ oon.

From the above-mentioned methodology of the Prophet (r) and his
companions and that of the early generations of Muslim scholars which followed
them, the following steps have been deduced by orthodox scholars as being the
necessary conditions for making correct tafseer of the Qur’aan:

1. Tafseer of Qur **’** aan by Qur **’** aan

There are many places in the Qur’aan where questions are asked in order
to catch the mind of the reader and subsequently answered to increase the impact
of the concept in question. In other places, general statements are made and then


later explained in order to vary the modes of presentation and encourage readers
and listeners to reflect more. This self-explanatory process is referred to as tafseer
of the Qur’aan by Qur’aan. Allaah chose to clarify what He intended by revealing
other explanatory verses. For example, Allaah asks,

**قَّ ارِطال ما راكدأﹶ وما** 4 **ِقَّ ارِطوال**

```
“ By at-Taariq (the Knocker or Night Approacher) — and what will
make you understand what at-Taariq is? ”
```
He then answers His question in the next verse:

**بالثَّ اقِ مجالن**

```
“ It is the piercing star (Venus). ”^16
```
Allaah also states in the Qur’aan:

**كﹸمعلﹶي يتلﹶى ما إِلاَّ الﹾأﹶنعامِ بهِيمةﹸ لﹶكﹸم تأﹸحِلَّ ِدبِالﹾعقﹸو أﹶوفﹸوا آمنوا الَّ ذِين ياأﹶيها**

```
“ O you who believe...beasts which are herded have been made halaal
for you except what will be recited to you. ”^17
```
Two verses later he elaborates the exceptions to the general rule:

**نِقﹶةﹸخوالﹾمن بِهِ اللَّ هِ لِغيرِ أﹸهِلَّ ماو ِيرِترِخالﹾ ولﹶحم والدم الﹾميتةﹸ علﹶيكﹸم تحرم**

**السبع أﹶكﹶلﹶ وما ِيحةﹸطوالن يةﹸدوالﹾمتر ﹸةوالﹾموقﹸوذﹶ**

```
“ Animals that died without being slaughtered, blood, pork, animals
sacrificed for other than Allaah, animals strangled to death, killed by
```
(^16) Soorah at-Taariq (86):1-3.
(^17) Soorah al-Maa _’_ idah (5):1.


```
a blow or by falling from a height, killed by goring, or partially eaten
by wild animals are forbidden to you. ”^18
```
Another example can be seen in the verse in which Allaah describes Himself,
saying:

**الﹾأﹶبصار تدرِكﹸه لاﹶ**

```
“ Sight cannot encompass Him. ”^19
```
This verse implies that Allaah will not be seen in either this world or the
next. However, Allaah later describes the believers in the next life as:

**ﹲةِرظنا ربها إِلﹶى**

```
“ Gazing at their Lord, ”^20
```
and he says about the disbelievers:

**وبونﹶجلﹶمح يومئِذٍ ربهِم عن إِنهم َّلاكﹶ**

```
“ Verily, they will be veiled from their Lord on that day. ”^21
```
Therefore, before seeking an explanation or interpretation elsewhere, the Qur’aan
must be relied upon to explain itself, for Allaah knows best what He intended.

2. Tafseer of Qur **’** aan by the Sunnah

On many occasions, the Prophet (r) added further clarification to various
verses of the Qur’aan. Allaah had entrusted the job of explaining the Qur’aan to
the Prophet (r). This trust was expressed in the Qur’aan in no uncertain terms,

(^18) Soorah al-Maa _’_ idah (5):3.
(^19) Soorah al-An _‘_ aam (6):103.
(^20) Soorah al-Qiyaamah (75):23.
(^21) Soorah al-Mutaffifeen (83):15.


**إِلﹶيهِم نزلﹶ ما لِلناسِ لِتبين الذِّ كﹾر إِلﹶيك وأﹶنزلﹾنا**

```
“ We have revealed the Reminder (Qur ’ aan) to you (O Muhammad)
so that you may explain to the people what has been revealed to
them. ”^22
```
**فِيهِ اختلﹶفﹸوا الَّ ذِي لﹶهم لِتبين إِلاَّ الﹾكِتاب علﹶيك أﹶنزلﹾنا وما**

```
“ We have only revealed the Book to you (O Muhammad) in order
that you clarify for them the things about which they differ. ”^23
```
The sahaabah understood this clearly and always turned to the Prophet (r) for
clarification whenever they were in doubt about the meaning of any of the
Qur’aanic passages. In fact, most of the fine details of salaah, zakaah, sawm,
hajj, inheritance laws, etc. were explained either by the Prophet’s statements or
practical demonstrations and applications (the Sunnah). Thus, the Prophet’s
explanations of Qur’aanic passages are referred to as the tafseer of the Qur’aan by
the Sunnah. For example, in Soorah al-Faatihah, the Prophet (r) explained that
“al-maghdoobi **‘** alayhim” (those on whom is Allaah’s anger) are the Jews, and
“ad-daalleen” (those astray) are the Christians.^24 On one occasion he recited the
verse:

**ٍةقﹸو مِن ﹶعتمطاست ما لﹶهم وأﹶعِدوا**

```
“ Prepare for them whatever force you are able to. ”^25
```
He then said,

( الرمي الﹾقﹸوةﹶ إِنَّ أﹶلاﹶ الرمي الﹾقﹸوةﹶ إِنَّ أﹶلاﹶ الرمي الﹾقﹸوةﹶ إِنَّ أﹶلاﹶ )

(^22) Soorah an-Nahl (16):44.
(^23) Soorah an-Nahl (16):64.
(^24) Reported by ‘Adee ibn Haatim and collected by at-Tirmithee and Ahmad. Rated hasan by al-
Albaanee in Saheeh Sunan at-Tirmithee, vol. 3, pp. 19-20, no. 2353.
(^25) Soorah al-Anfaal (8):60.


```
“ Verily force is shooting. ” He repeated it three times.^26
```
In another narration, he explained that the verse:

**الﹾكﹶوثﹶر ﹶيناكطأﹶع إِنا**

```
“ Verily, We have given you al-Kawthar, ”^27
```
referred to a river in Paradise which Allaah has given him.^28

Because the Sunnah was based on guidance from Allaah, it represents the
second part of God’s promise to explain the Qur’aan:

**بيانه علﹶينا إِنَّ ثﹸم**

```
“ Then, verily, it is for Us to explain it. ”^29
```
Ibn ’Abbaas explained that the statement, **“** Then it is for Us to explain it, **”**
means, “upon your tongue [O Muhammad].”^30 Consequently, no other human
interpretation can be given precedence over that of the Prophet (r).

3. Tafseer of Qur **’** aan by Aathaar

Whenever the sahaabah could not find the tafseer of a passage in the
Qur’aan itself or in the Sunnah, they would use their own reasoning based on their
knowledge of the contexts of the verses and the intricacies of the Arabic language
in which the Qur’aan was revealed. Consequently, one of the greatest
commentators of the Qur’aan, Ibn Katheer, wrote in the preface of his tafseer, “If
we are unable to find a suitable tafseer in the Qur’aan or in the Sunnah, we go to
the opinions of the sahaabah. For verily, they knew the Qur’aan better than

(^26) Reported by ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir and collected by Muslim (Sahih Muslim, vol. 3, p. 1060, no.
4711). The word used in the hadeeth is ramy, which could mean shooting an arrow or throwing a
spear. It can also be applied to firing a gun or a rocket.
(^27) Soorah al-Kawthar (108):1.
(^28) Reported by Anas and collected by Muslim (Sahih Muslim, vol. 1, p. 220, no. 790) and Ahmad.
(^29) Soorah al-Qiyaamah (75):19
(^30) Sahih Al-Bukhari, vol. 6, p. 422, no. 450.


anyone else due to their knowledge of the circumstances of its revelation, their
complete and accurate understanding of it, and their righteous deeds.” These
explanations of the sahaabah are known as tafseer by aathaar (the sayings of the
sahaabah). For example, when Ibn ‘Abbaas was questioned about the verse:

**ما إِلاَّ ِينتهنز يبدِين ولاﹶ فﹸروجهن ويحفﹶظﹾن أﹶبصارِهِن مِن نضضيغ لِلﹾمؤمِناتِ وقﹸلﹾ**

**مِنها ﹶهرظ**

```
“ And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their
chastity and to only reveal from their adornment that which
(normally) appears, ”^31
```
he replied, “It refers to the face and hands.”^32 On another occasion, after reciting
the verse,

**الﹾكﹶافِرونﹶ هم فﹶأﹸولﹶئِك اللَّ ه أﹶنزلﹶ بِما يحكﹸم لﹶم ومن**

```
“ And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, is a
kaafir (disbeliever). ”^33
```
Ibn ‘Abbaas said, “It is a form of kufr (disbelief) less than real kufr. _”_^34

(^31) Soorah an-Noor (24): 31.
(^32) Collected by Ibn Abee Shaybah in al-Musannaf, vol. 4, p. 283, and al-Bayhaqee in as-Sunan al-
Kubraa. Al-Albaanee ruled in Jilbaab al-Mar _’_ ah al-Muslimah, pp. 59-60, that the isnaad of this
statement is saheeh.
(^33) Soorah al-Maa _’_ idah (5):44
(^34) Collected by al-Haakim, vol. 2, p. 313. A similar statement was collected by Ibn Jareeer in his
Tafseer, vol. 4, p. 597, no. 12068. This issue is one of the raging controversies of our time, the
question being: Does Ibn ‘Abbaas’s statement apply to rulers in our time, who rule by mixtures of
Sharee _‘_ ah law and man-made law. The position of most scholars seems to be that when the ruler
believes that man-made laws are better than or as good as the Sharee _‘_ ah, or that even though they
aren’t as good as the Sharee _‘_ ah, it is permissible to rule by them, then he is a kaafir who has left
Islaam. If, however, he applies man-made laws while believing that he is sinful in doing so, his
kufr is kufr of actions, which makes him a major sinner, but doesn’t place him out of the fold of
Islaam. See at-Tah-theer min Fitnah at-Takfeer by Shaykh al-Albaanee, who provides copious
documentation from the statements of classical and modern salafee scholars to support his
position.


However, the tafseer transmitted from the Prophet (r) and the sahaabah
did not cover all of the verses of the Qur’aan. The Prophet (r) explained only
what was unclear to the sahaabah, and they, in turn, only explained what was
unclear to the taabi _‘_ oon. But with each succeeding generation, more areas became
unclear due to the evolution of the language. Hence, the taabi _‘_ oon had to make
further explanations after the passing of the sahaabah _’_ s era. These explanations
are considered a part of tafseer by aathaar and should be given precedence over
personal opinions where there is unanimity among them. Where they differed,
none of their opinions is given preference over the others unless it is supported by
the language.

During the era of the taabi _‘_ oon, many Christians and Jews became
Muslim. As a result, some of the taabi _‘_ oon narrated tales from Jewish and
Christian sources in their explanations of the Qur’aan. Such narrations became
known as Israa _’_ eeleeyaat. In later generations, the books of tafseer became filled
with such narrations, many of which could not be traced to any reliable source.

4. Tafseer of Qur **’** aan by Language

With the passage of time, words took on new meanings and old meanings
became lost, foreign words entered into the language, and vast sections of
vocabulary fell into disuse. This natural process necessitated the explanation of
some of the Qur’aanic words according to their literal and grammatical meanings.
Consequently, this period witnessed the appearance of dictionaries written
specifically to deal with Qur’aanic Arabic vocabulary and philology. In cases
where words had more than one meaning, this step created differences of opinion
which could only be solved by finding some support in the Sunnah. For example,
“lams _”_ literally means to touch, but figuratively it means sexual intercourse.
Thus, the later scholars were of two basic opinions concerning the following
verse,

**ﹶيباط عِيداص وافﹶتيمم ًماء ِدواجت فﹶلﹶم النساءَ لاﹶمستم أﹶو**

```
“ ...or you (laamastum) women and cannot find water, then make
tayammum (ritual purification with dust). ”^35
```
(^35) Soorah an-Nisaa _’_ (4):43.


Imaams ash-Shaafi‘ee and Maalik held that it meant the touch of the hand, though

each imaam added certain stipulations to it. On the other hand, Imaam Aboo
Haneefah ruled that it meant sexual intercourse. However, the Prophet’s wives

reported that he kissed them before performing salaah, which indicated that
touching was not intended by this verse.^36

These four methods come under the general title of tafseer bir-riwaayah
or tafseer bil-ma _’_ thoor (tafseer based on narration) and, as such, leave little room
for argument. Although the fourth step is oftentimes based on narrations from
earlier generations, at other times it can be highly opinionated and controversial.
For example, Yusuf Ali openly translates the word “burooj” used in the 85th
soorah as “the Zodiacal signs,” while Pickthall translates it as “Mansions of the
Stars,” but says in his introduction to the soorah that it “is applied to the signs of
the zodiac.” Thus, according to them, Allaah is making an oath by the zodiacal
signs. Some English-speaking Muslims have taken this to be indirect support for
astrology. However, “burooj” originally only meant “star configuration,” and it
was not until later times that it was used to refer to the imaginary figures of the
zodiac, which pagan Babylonians and Greeks superimposed on them. Astrology
has been forbidden by the Prophet (r) in no uncertain terms, as it falls under the
general prohibition on visiting fortunetellers. The Prophet (r) said,

( محمدٍ علﹶى أﹸنزِلﹶ بِما كﹶفﹶر فﹶقﹶد كﹶاهِنا ... أﹶتى من )

“Whoever...visits a fortuneteller [and believes in what he says]^37 has disbelieved
in what was revealed to Muhammad. _”_^38

5. Tafseer of Qur **’** aan by Opinion

Opinions based on a careful study of the first four steps can be considered
valid as long as they do not contradict any of those steps. Likewise, the
application of obvious meanings of the Qur’aan to existing situations and the

formation of conclusions based on their similarities are also allowed, as long as

such interpretations do not clash with authentic classical explanations. But, free
interpretation based on philosophical, scientific, or sectarian ideas is totally

forbidden. The Prophet (r) was reported to have said,

إِلﹶى فﹶردوه مِنه جهِلﹾتم وما فﹶاعملﹸوا مِنه عرفﹾتم فﹶما ) مراتٍ ثﹶلاﹶثﹶ (. كﹸفﹾر آنِالﹾقﹸر فِي الﹾمِراءُ )

(.عالِمِهِ

“Opinion based argument about the Qur _’_ aan is kufr. _”_ He repeated it three times,
then said, _“_ What you know of it, act upon; and what you are ignorant of, refer it
to one who knows. _”_^39

We can see from the above-mentioned hadeeth that the Prophet (r) sternly
warned his companions and later generations of Muslims about interpretations of
the Qur’aan based on speculation and unsubstantiated opinions. The reason is that
the Qur’aan is the foundation of Islaam and, as such, it had to remain pure and
untampered with. If free rein was given to any and everyone to interpret the
Qur’aan as they wished, its value would be totally destroyed, and Islaam itself
would be undermined from its base. Thus, the only acceptable tafseer is that
which adheres to the following sequence: tafseer of Qur’aan by the Qur’aan, then
by the Sunnah, then by the sayings of the sahaabah, then by language, and finally
by opinion, as long as it is based on the preceding four methods and does not
contradict any of them.

Deviant Tafseers

In order to clarify the potential danger and corruption inherent in tafseer
by unsubstantiated opinion, the following examples of deviant tafseers have been
collected from various movements, sects, and philosophical schools from the
distant past to the present. From the tenth century CE (4th century AH), some
Soofees have interpreted “Pharaoh” to mean the heart in Allaah’s command to
Prophet Moosaa:

**ﹶغىط إِنه فِرعونﹶ إِلﹶى باذﹾه**

(^39) Reported by Aboo Hurayrah and collected by Ahmad, Ibn Jareer in his Tafseer and Aboo
Ya‘laa. Authenticated by al-Albaanee in Silsilah al Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah, vol. 4. pp. 26-8.


```
“ Go to Pharaoh, for verily he has transgressed, ”^40
```
as it is the heart which oppresses every man, causing him to transgress. Others
interpreted Allaah’s command to Prophet Moosaa:

**عصاك ِقوأﹶلﹾ**

```
“ Throw down your staff, ”^41
```
as a command to throw aside the material world and only depend on Allaah.
These spiritualistic tafseers are indicative of the Soofee movement’s
overemphasis of the spiritual over the material.

In the Mu‘tazilee (Rationalist) tafseers of the ‘Abbaasid era, revelation
was interpreted according to human logic. Hence, the word “heart” in the
following verse was given a new meaning:

**ولﹶكِن بلﹶى قﹶالﹶ تؤمِن أﹶولﹶم قﹶالﹶ الﹾموتى تحىِ فكﹶي أﹶرِنِى رب إِبراهِيم قﹶالﹶ إِذﹾ و**

**قﹶلﹾبِى ﹾمئِنطلِّ ي**

```
“ And (remember) when Ibraaheem said, ‘ My Lord, show me how
You give life to the dead. ’ [Allaah] replied, ‘ Do you not believe? ’
Ibraaheem said, ‘ Yes, but (I am asking You) in order that my heart
may be at rest. ”^42
```
It was claimed that Ibraaheem had a friend whom he referred to as his “heart”
and, thus, the true meaning of the verse was, “Yes, but I am asking You in order
that my friend may be at ease.”^43 This interpretation was considered necessary to
explain away the doubt which Ibraaheem felt in his heart, as it seemed
inconsistent with prophethood, according to the Rationalists.

The Shee‘ah tafseers of the late ‘Abbaasid era, under the influence of their
inordinate obsession with the Prophet’s descendants, interpreted the verse:

(^40) Soorah an-Naazi _‘_ aat (79):17.
(^41) Soorah an-Naml (27):10.
(^42) Soorah al-Baqarah (2):260.
(^43) This tafseer given by Ibn Fawrak is quoted in Mabaahith fee _‘_ Uloom al-Qur _’_ aan, p. 358.


**يلﹾتقِيانِ الﹾبحرينِ جمر**

```
“ He has let the two seas flow freely and they meet, ”^44
```
as a reference to ‘Alee, the Prophet’s son-in-law, and Faatimah, the Prophet’s
daughter; and in a following verse:

**والﹾمرجانﹸ ولﹸؤ ُّالل مِنهما جرخي**

```
“ Out of them come pearls and coral, ”^45
```
they found a reference to the Prophet’s grandsons, al-Hasan and al-Husayn.^46

The Qaadiyanee sect, which appeared in India during the latter part of the
nineteenth century, claimed that in the verse,

**ينالنبِي وخاتم ِﷲا رسولﹶ ولﹶكِن رجالِكﹸم مِن أﹶحدٍ أﹶبا محمد كﹶانﹶ ما**

```
“ Muhammad is not the father of any of you, but he is Allaah ’ s
messenger and the seal (khaatam) of the Prophets, ”^47
```
khaatam does not mean seal, as most translate it, but ring. Thus, they claimed that
just as the ring beautifies the finger, the Prophet Muhammad (r) was the
beautification of prophethood. Therefore, the meaning of the verse is that Prophet
Muhammad (r) was the most superior of the prophets but not the last.^48 They also
assert that even if the word khaatam were taken to mean “seal,” it would be like
the seal placed on an envelope sealing its contents, but not limiting them. These
interpretations were made to validate the claim of their founder, Ghulam Ahmad,
to prophethood. They also distorted the following verse in reference to Prophet
‘Eesaa:

(^45) Soorah ar-Rahmaan (55):22.
(^46) Ibn Baabooyah in al-Khisaal. Quoted in Bihaar al-Anwaar, vol. 24, pp. 97-9, nos. 1-7.
(^47) Soorah al-Ahzaab (33):40.

```
“ They did not crucify him nor did they kill him, but it was made to
seem so to them....But Allaah raised him up to Himself. ”^49
```
They claimed that “raised him up” meant a figurative raising, as used in the verse:

**ذِكﹾرك لﹶك ورفﹶعنا**

```
“ And We raised your esteem for you. ”^50
```
This interpretation was necessary in order for them to prove their doctrine that
‘Eesaa died a natural death on earth after marrying and having children and being
buried in Kashmir, and that Ghulam Ahmad was the promised messiah whose
return was prophesied.^51

Even more recently in America, Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Elijah
sect and claimant to Prophethood (d. 1975), interpreted the verse,

**رقﹰاز يومئِذٍ ينرِمِجالﹾم نحشر و الصورِ فِي خينفﹶ يوم**

```
“ On that day when the trumpet is blown, We will assemble the
criminals blue-eyed, ”^52
```
as proof that the inhabitants of the fire will all be white people. This interpretation
was used to support the Elijah doctrine that Allaah, God, was a black man, that all
black people were gods and that all white people were devils.^53 Although the
word zurq literally means blue, it was used to refer to the clouding of the cornea
due to certain eye diseases which gives the eye a bluish-grey tinge. Hence, a
more accurate translation would have been “bleary-eyed.”

(^49) Soorah an-Nisaa _’_ (4):157-8.

(^51) Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islaam, p. 24.
(^52) Soorah Taa Haa (20):102.
(^53) Message to the Black Man in America, p. 14.


According to Elijah, since the white man resembles the black man, he was
referred to as “mankind” in the Qur’aan, that is, a kind of man!^54 Therefore, in
the verse:

**وأﹸنثﹶى ذﹶكﹶرٍ مِن خلﹶقﹾناكﹸم إِنا الناس ياأﹶيها**

```
“ O mankind, verily, We have created you from a male and a
female, ”^55
```
“We” was interpreted by Elijah to refer to the black men/gods who supposedly
created the white race (mankind).^56

These few examples of tafseers based solely on sectarian opinions clearly
show the incoherence and deception that result from the disregard for the correct
method of tafseer. The Qur’aan becomes a voice for each sect’s deviant and
heretical claims. The Qur’aan is manipulated mercilessly, as there are no logical
boundaries nor coherent rules by which the founders of these sects abide; hence,
the same verse may have a multiplicity of meanings for them. Whatever
interpretation promotes their ideas become correct. For them, the Qur’aan is no
longer a book of guidance, but a book containing the hidden secrets of their sect,
which only their leaders and the specially initiated can unlock.

3.1 DEFINITIONS

Definition of _Hadeeth_

The Arabic word hadeeth basically means ‘an item of news, conversation, a tale, a
story or a report,’ whether historical or legendary, true or false, relating to the
present or the past. Its secondary meaning as an adjective is ‘new’ as opposed to
qadeem, ‘old’. However, like other Arabic words (e.g. salaah, zakaah), its
meaning changed in Islaam. From the time of the Prophet (r), his stories and
communications dominated all other forms of communication. Consequently, the
term hadeeth began to be used almost exclusively for reports which spoke of his
actions and sayings.^1

Usage of the Word _hadeeth_

The term hadeeth has been used in both the Qur’aan^2 and the prophetic traditions
according to all of its linguistic meanings. The following three categories are the
most notable usages. It has been used to mean:

a) The Qur’aan itself

**الﹾحدِيثِ بِهذﹶا يكﹶذِّ ب ومن ذﹶرنِيفﹶ**

```
“ Then leave Me alone with those who reject this communication
(Qur ’ aan)... ”
Soorah al-Qalam, (68):44
```
اﷲِ كِتاب الﹾحدِيثِ أﹶحسن ََّﹶنإِ

```
“Indeed, the best form of communication is the Book of Allaah...”^3
```
b) A historical story

###### وسىم حدِيثﹸ أﹶتاك هلﹾو

(^1) Hadith Literature, p. 1 and Studies in Hadith Methodology and Literature, pp. 1-3.
(^2) The term hadeeth is mentioned 23 times in the Qur’aan.
(^3)


```
“ Has the story of Moses reached you? ” SoorahTaahaa, (20):9
```
حرج ولاﹶ إِسرائِيلﹶ بنِي عن دثﹸواح

```
“You may speak about the Children of Israel without ...”^4
```
c) A general conversation

**حدِيثاﹰ هِأﹶزواجِ بعضِ إِلﹶى النبِي أﹶسر إِذﹶاو**

**“** When the Prophet confided in one of his wives... **”** Soorah at-Tahreem, (66):3.

اﹾلأَنك أﹸذﹸنِهِ فِي صب مِنه، يفِرونﹶ أﹶو كﹶارِهونﹶ لﹶه وهم قﹶومٍ حدِيثِ إِلﹶى استمع نِم

```
“Molten copper will be poured in the ear of whoever eavesdrops on the
conversation of people who dislike him doing so or flee from him.”^5
```
Among the hadeeth scholars the term hadeeth means ‘whatever is transmitted
from the Prophet of his actions, sayings, tacit approvals, or physical
characteristics. Scholars of Islaamic Law do not include the physical appearance
of the Prophet in their definition.

Importance of _Hadeeth_ :

1. Revelation

The Prophet’s sayings and actions were primarily based on revelation from Allaah
and, as such, must be considered a fundamental source of guidance second only to
the Qur’aan. Allaah in the Qur’aan said concerning the Prophet (r):

**يوحى وحي إِلاَّ هو إِنﹾ الﹾهوى عنِ ينطِق ما و**

(^4) Saheeh Al Bukhaaree, vol.
(^5) Saheeh Al Bukhaaree, vol.


```
“ He (Muhammad) does not speak from his desires; indeed, what he
says is revelation. ” Soorah an-Najm (53):3-4
```
Therefore, the hadeeth represents a personal source of divine guidance which
Allaah granted His Prophet (r) which was similar in its nature to the Qur’aan

itself. The Prophet (r) reiterated this point in one of his recorded statements,
“Indeed, I was given the Qur _’_ aan and something similar to it along with it.”^6

2. Tafseer:

The preservation of the Qur’aan was not restricted to protecting its wording from
change. Were that the case, its meanings could be manipulated according to
human desires, while maintaining its wording. However, Allaah also protected its
essential meanings from change by entrusting the explanation of the meanings of
Qur’aan to the Prophet (r) himself. Allaah states the following in the Qur’aan
regarding its interpretation:

**إِلﹶيهِم نزلﹶ ما لِلناسِ لِتبين الذِّ كﹾر إِلﹶيك أﹶنزلﹾنا و**

```
“ And I revealed to you the Reminder (Qur ’ aan) in order that you
explain to the people what was revealed to them. ” Soorah an-Nahl,
(16):44
```
Therefore, if one is to understand the meanings of Qur’aan, he or she must
consider what the Prophet (r) said or did regarding it. E.g. In the Qur’aan, Allaah
instructs the believers to offer salaah (formal prayers) and pay zakaah (obligatory
charity) in Soorah al-Baqarah, (2), verse 43. However, in order to obey these
instructions correctly, one must study the methodology of the Prophet (r) in this
regard. Among his many clarifications concerning salaah and zakaah, he
instructed his followers saying “Pray as you saw me pray,”^7 and he specified that
2.5% of surplus wealth, unused for a year,^8 should be given as zakaah.

3. Laws

One of the primary duties of the Prophet (r) was to judge between people in their
disputes. Since his judgements were all based on revelation, as stated earlier, they

(^6)
(^7)
(^8)


must be considered a primary source of principles by which judgements are
carried out in an Islaamic State. Allaah also addressed this responsibility in the
Qur’aan saying:

**في تنازعتم فﹶإِنﹾ مِنكﹸم اﹾلأَمرِ وأﹸولِي الرسولﹶ وأﹶطِيعوا اﷲَ أﹶطِيعوا آمنوا الذِّ ين اأﹶيهاي**

###### والرسولِ اﷲِ إِلﹶى فﹶردوه شيءٍ

```
“ O believers, obey Allaah, obey the Messenger and those in authority
among you. If you dispute about anything, refer it to Allaah and the
Messenger. ” Soorah an-Nisaa, (4):59
```
Thus, hadeeths are essential for the smooth running of the law courts in an
Islaamic State.

4. Moral Ideal

Since the Prophet (r) was guided by revelation in his personal life, his character
and social interactions became prime examples of moral conduct for Muslims
until the Last Day. Attention was drawn to this fact in the following Qur’aanic
verse:

###### حسنةﹰ أﹸسوةﹰ اﷲِ رسولِ في لﹶكﹸم كﹶانﹶ قﹶدلﹶ

```
“Surely there is for all of you a good example (of conduct) in the way of
Allaah’s Messenger.”
Soorah al-Ahzaab, (33):21
```
Consequently, the daily life of the Prophet (r) as recorded in hadeeth represents
an ideal code of good conduct. In fact, when the Prophet’s wife, ‘Aa’ishah, was
asked about his conduct, she replied, “His character was the Qur’aan.”^9

5. Preservation of Islaam

The science of narration, collection and criticism of hadeeth was unknown to the
world prior to the era of the Prophet (r). In fact, it was due in part to the absence
of such a reliable science that the messages of the former prophets became lost or

(^9)


distorted in the generations that followed them. Therefore, it may be said that it is
largely due to the science of hadeeth that the final message of Islaam has been
preserved in it is original purity for all times. This is alluded to in the Qur’aanic
verse:

**لﹶحافِظﹸونﹶ لﹶه وإِنا الذِّ كﹾر نزلﹾنا نحن ناإِ**

```
“Indeed, I have revealed the Reminder, I will, indeed, protect it.” Soorah
al-Hijr, (15):9
```
_Hadeeth_ and the _Sunnah_

The term hadeeth has become a synonym for the term sunnah, though there is
some difference in their meanings. Sunnah, according to Arabic lexicographers,
means ‘a way; course; rule; manner of acting or conduct of life’.^10 Sunnah, as a
technical term in the Science of hadeeth, refers to whatever statements, acts,
approvals, physical or character descriptions that are attributable to the Prophet
(r) along with his biography before or after the beginning of his prophethood. It
is thus synonymous with the term hadeeth.

However, according to Usool al-Fiqh science (legal methodology), sunnah
refers to only the statements, acts and approvals of the Prophet (r). It also refers
to whatever is supported by evidence from the sharee _‘_ ah; the opposite of bid _‘_ ah.
And in the Legalistic science of Fiqh the term sunnah refers to recommended acts
authentically attributable to the Prophet (r); the does of which is rewarded and
the non-doer is not punished. It is also used to refer to the opposite of bid _‘_ ah as in
the statement: Sunnah divorce and Bid _‘_ ah divorce.

According to its general definition, the Qur’aan is the most important part
of the sunnah conveyed by the Prophet (r).^11 It may also be said that the
hadeeths were the containers or storehouse in which the sunnah of the Prophet
(r) was conveyed during his life time and after his death.

12

Collected by al-Bukhaaree

This means that the Hadeeth scholar Muhammad ibn Ismaa‘eel al-Bukhaaree
collected in his book of Hadeeths called Saheeh al-Bukhaaree the statement:
_“_ None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for
himself. _”_ which he heard from his Hadeeth teacher Musaddad, who heard it from
his teacher Yahyaa, who was informed by his teacher Shu‘bah that he heard it
from his teacher Qataadah, a student of the Prophet’s companions, who heard it
quoted by the Prophet’s companion Anas ibn Maalik from Prophet Muhammad
(r).

COMPONENTS

A Hadeeth consists of two main parts: the Sanad (السند) and the Matn. (المتن)

The _Sanad_ (also called _Isnaad_ )

The list of the narrators of the saying or action of the Prophet (r) is called the
Sanad. For example, in the above Hadeeth the Sanad is: “Musaddad told us that

(^12) (Sahih Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English), vol.1, p.19, no.12). It is also collected by Muslim (Sahih
Muslim (English Trans.), vol.1, p.31, no.72).


Yahyaa informed him from Shu‘bah from Qataadah from Anas from the Prophet
(r) that he said:”

The _Matn_

The text of the Hadeeth or what the Prophet (r) actually said or did is called the
Matn. For example, in the above Hadeeth the Matn is: “None of you truly
believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.”


```
3.2 COMPILATION OF HADEETH
```
I. Era of The Prophet

During the life of the Prophet (r) there was no pressing need to write down all of
his various statements or record his actions because he was present and could be

consulted at any time. As a matter of fact, the Prophet (r) himself made a general
prohibition against writing down his statements which were other than the
Qur’aan itself.^1 He was reported to have said, “Don _’_ t write anything from me
besides the Qur _’_ aan. If you do so, erase it.” This was to prevent the possibility of
mixing up the Qur’aan with his own words during the era of revelation.
Consequently, the greatest stress regarding writing was placed on recording the
Qur’aanic verses. However, there are many authentic narrations collected by the
Scholars of Hadeeth, that prove that Hadeeth were recorded in writing even
during the lifetime of the Prophet (r). For example, ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr said: “I
used to write everything which I heard from the Messenger of Allaah (r) with
the intention of memorizing it. However, some Qurayshites forbade me from
doing so saying, ‘Do you write everything that you hear from him, while the
Messenger of Allaah is a human being who speaks in anger and pleasure?’ So I
stopped writing, and mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah (r). He pointed with
his finger to his mouth and said: ‘Write! By Him in whose hand is my soul, only
truth comes out from it.’^2

Aboo Hurayrah said: When Makkah was conquered, the Prophet (r) stood
up and gave a sermon [Aboo Hurayrah then mentioned the sermon]. A man from
Yemen, called Aboo Shaah got up and said, “O Messenger of Allaah! Write it
down for me.” The Messenger of Allaah (r) replied, “Write it for Aboo Shaah.”^3
Al-Waleed asked Aboo ‘Amr, “What are they writing?” He replied, “The sermon
which he heard that day.”^4

others considered it to be a statement of Aboo Sa ‘eed himself that was erroneously attributed to

was asked which city will be conquered first Constantinople or Rome? So
‘Abdullaah called for a sealed trunk and he said, “Take out the book from it.”
Then ‘Abdullaah said, “While we were with the Messenger of Allaah (r) writing,
The Messenger of Allaah (r) was asked, “Which city will be conquered first,
Constantinople or Rome?” So Allaah’s Messenger (r) said: “The city of
Heracilius will be conquered first.” meaning Constantinople.”^5

II. Era of The Sahaabah^6

After the death of the Prophet (r) his saying and action took of a new importance
because he was no longer there to consult when problems arose. The practise of
narration on a large scale started during this period. For example, when the
Prophet (r) died, the Sahaabah debated about where to bury him. This debate
ended when Aboo Bakr told them that the Prophet (r) had said, “Prophets should
be buried wherever they die.” Thus a grave was dug immediately below the bed
on which he died in the house of ‘Aa’ishah. In this period a number of the leading
Sahaabah wrote down hadeeths of the Prophet (r).

The following are just a few of the leading narrators of the Prophet’s traditions
who were known to have recorded them in writing.

Aboo Hurayrah to whom 5374 channels of hadeeth narrations are attributed,
actually narrated 1236 hadeeth. Hasan in ‘Amr ad-Damaree saw many books in
his possession.^7

**‘** Abdullaah ibn **‘** Abbaas to whom 1660 channels of narrations are attributed
used to write whatever he heard^8 and even employed his slaves to record for him.^9

**‘** Abdullaah ibn **‘** Amr ibn al- **‘** Aas to whom 700 channels are attributed was
know to recorded books of hadeeths during the Prophet’s lifetime with he titled
as-Saheefah as-Saheehah.

Aboo Bakr was reported to have written down over 500 different sayings of the
Prophet (r).

(^5) Saheeh: Musnad Ahmad (2/176), Sunan ad-Daarimee (1/126) and Mustadrak al
Haakim (3/422).
(^6) The disciples or the companions of the Prophet (r), as-Sahaabah, are sometimes referred to as
the first generation of Islaam. Any person who had the privilege of meeting the Prophet (r) and
died believing in him is classified as a Sahaabee e.g. Aboo Bakr and Ibn ‘Abbaas.

(^8) Tabaqaat ibn Sa _‘_ d, vol. 2, p. 123.
(^9) Tarateeb, by al-Kattaanee, vol. 2, no. 247.


Ibn al-Jawzee, who provides a list of all the companions who related traditions,
gives the names of about 1,060 together with the number of hadeeths related by
each. 500 related only 1 hadeeth each; 132 related only 2 each; 80 related 3; 52
related 4; 32 related 5; 26 related 6; 27 related 7; 18 related 8; 11 related 9; 60
related between 10 and 20; 84 related between 20 and 100; 27 related between
100 and 500 and only 11 related more than 500 of which only 6 related more than
1,000 hadeeth, and they are commonly referred to as the mukaththiroon (the
reporters of many traditions). Today, a graduate of the college of hadeeth in the
Islamic University of Madeenah is required to memorize 250 hadeeth during each
of the four years of his study (i.e., a total of 1,000 hadeeths).

From the above, it can readily be seen that fewer than 300 companions related
the vast majority of traditions.^10

III. Era of The Taabi’oon
**11
1** ) st Century Hijrah)

After Islaam had spread into the Middle East, India, North Africa and the
narration of Hadeeth had become widespread, there arose people who began to
invent Hadeeths. To combat this development, Caliph ‘Umar ibn Abdul-Azeez
(reign 99 to 101 AH - 71 8 to 720 C.E.) ordered the scholars to compile the

traditions of the Prophet (r). The scholars had already begun composing books
containing biographical data on the various narrators of Hadeeth in order to
expose the liars and fabricators. Aboo Bakr ibn Hazm (d.120/737) was among
those directed by the Caliph to compile the Hadeeth. Caliph ‘Umar requested him
to write down all the hadeeths of the Prophet (r) and of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab
and to pay particular attention to gathering the hadeeths of ‘Amrah bint ‘Abdir-
Rahmaan, who was at that time the most respected custodian of the narrations of
‘Aa’ishah. Sa‘d ibn Ibraaheem and Ibn Shihaab az-Zuhree were also requested to
compile books and az-Zuhree became the first compiler of hadeeth to record the
biographies of the narrators with particular reference to their character and
honesty. In this period the systematic compilation of hadeeths was begun on a
fairly wide scale.

(^10) Hadith Literature, pp. 18-19.
(^11) The generation which followed the companions studying under them are referred to as the
Tabi’oon (followers or sucessers) e.g. Aboo Haneefah and Mujaahid.


However, among the students of the companions, many recorded hadeeths and
collected them in books. The following is a list of the top 12 narrators of hadeeths
among the Prophet’s companions and their students who had their narrations in
written form.

Aboo Hurayrah (5374)
**12**
: Nine of his students were recorded to have written

hadeeths from him.

Ibn **‘** Umar (2630): Eight of his students wrote down hadeeths from him.

Anas ibn Maalik (2286): Sixteen of his students had hadeeths in written form
from him.

**‘** Aa **’** ishah bint Abee Bakr (2210): Three of her students had her hadeeths in
written form.

Ibn **‘** Abbaas (1660): Nine of his students recorded his hadeeths in books.

Jaabir ibn **‘** Abdillaah (1540): Fourteen of his students wrote down his hadeeths.

Aboo Sa **‘** eed al-Khudree (1170): None of his students wrote.

Ibn Mas **‘** ood (748): None of his students wrote.

**‘** Abdullaah ibn **‘** Amr ibn al- **‘** Aas (700): Seven of his students had his hadeeths
in written form.

**‘** Umar ibn al-Khattaab (537): He recorded many hadeeths in official letters.

**‘** Alee ibn Abee Taalib (536): Eight of his students recorded his hadeeths in
writing.

Aboo Moosaa al-Ash **‘** aree (360): Some of his hadeeths were in the possession of
Ibn ‘Abbaas in written from.

Al-Barraa ibn **‘** Aazib (305): Was known to have dictated his narrations.

Of Aboo Hurayrah’s nine students known to have written hadeeths, Hammaam
ibn Munabbih’s book has survived in manuscript form and has been edited by Dr.
Muhammad Hamidullah and published in 1961 in Hyderabad, India.^13

(^12) The total number of hadeeths or more properly, channels of narration of hadeeth ascribed to the
companion.

IV. Era of The Taabi’ut-Taabi’een
**14
2** ) nd Century)

In the period following that of the Taabi’oon, the Hadeeths were systematically
collected and written in texts. One of the earliest works was al-Muwatta
composed by Maalik ibn Anas. Other books of hadeeth were also written by
scholars of Maalik’s time by the likes of al-Awzaa‘ee who lived in Syria,
‘Abdullaah ibn al-Mubaarak of Khurasaan, Hammaad ibn Salamah of Basrah and
Sufyaan ath-Thawree of Kufah. However, the only work which survived from that
time is that of Imaam Maalik. It could be said that in this period the majority of
the hadeeths were collected in the various centers of Islaam.

The reason why these three generations have been given special consideration is
because the Prophet (r) was reported to have said, “The best of generations is my
generation, then the one which follows them, then the one that follows them.” It
was through these three generations that hadeeth was first transmitted orally and
in writing, until they were completely compiled into collections on a wide and a
systematic scale.

V. Era of The Saheehs (3rd Century Hijrah)

There arose in the third century scholars who undertook the job of critical
research of the Hadeeths which were narrated and compiled in the first two
centuries. They also grouped the Hadeeths which they considered to be accurate
according to the branches of Islaamic Law. E.g. From this period is the book
Saheeh al-Bukhaaree containing 7,275 Hadeeth which al-Bukhaari (died- 870
C.E.) chose from 600,000 and Saheeh Muslim which contains 9,200 Hadeeths
which Imaam Muslim selected from 300,000. Besides these two works of
Hadeeth, there are four other works which became famous during this period.
They are the four sunan of Aboo Dawud (died 889 C.E.), at-Tirmithee (died 893
C.E.), an-Nasaa’ee (died 916 C.E.) and Ibn Maajah (died 908 C.E.).

Stages of writing

1. The first stage covers the period of the first century A.H. which began in July
    622 C.E. or the early \part of the century C.E. It was the age of the
    companions and their sucessors often referred to as the age of the Saheefah,
    that is, a sheet or some sort of writing material such as shoulder blades or

(^14) The generation of students of the successors, Taabi’oon are referred to as successors of
successors Taabi’ut-Tabi’een e.g. Maalik ibn Anas.


```
parchments on which a number of hadeeth were written. E.g. Saheefah Aboo
Bakr and Saheefah Saadiqah of ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr. The aim of the first
stage was mainly recording the hadeeth without any particular format.
```
2. The second period covers the middle of the second century A.H. is referred to
    as the stage of Musannaf (i.e. classified organized work). The second stage
    represents a planned compilation of hadeeth grouped under headings denoting
    their subject matter. E.g. Muwatta Maalik
3. The third stage known as the stage of Musnad (compilation of hadeeth
    according to the companion’s names). This stage began at the close of second
    century A.H. e.g. Musnad Ahmad.
4. The fourth and most important stage is known as the stage of Saheeh. This
    stage began during the first half of the third century A.H. (9th century C.E.)
    and overlaps the period of the musnad e.g. Saheeh al-Bukhaaree, Saheeh
    Muslim and Saheeh Ibn Khuzaymah.


```
3.3 ORIGINS OF THE ISNAAD
```
Every type of literature develops certain features particular to its nature and
content and the character of the people who cultivate it, and the distinctive social,
political or historical conditions in which it originates and flourishes. Hadeeth
literature is no exception to this rule.^1 The isnaad system was used to transmit
pre-Islamic poetry.^2 However, it was in the hadeeth literature that it reached its
peak at which it was considered an integral part of the religion itself. ‘Abdullaah
ibn al-Mubaarak (d. 181AH), one of the illustrious teachers of Imaam al-
Bukhaaree, said: “The isnaad is from the religion. Were it not for the isnaad
anyone could say anything he wished.”^3 By the end of the first century the
science of isnaad was fully developed. Ibn Seereen (d.110), a Successor, said,
“[In the beginning] they would not ask about the isnaad. But when the fitnah
(turmoil / civil war) happened, they demanded, ‘Name your men to us.’ The the
narrations of the Ahlus-Sunnah (Adherents to the Sunnah) would be accepted,
while those of Ahlul-Bida _’_ ah (Adherents to Innovations) would be rejected.”^4
That is, prior to the turmoil the isnaad was used only occasionally, but after the
turmoil they became cautious.

In order to minimize the significance of the system in Islaam, orientalist
scholars have tried to identify non-Arab pre-Islamic sources. Joseph Horovitz
cited several instances from Jewish literature in which the isnaad was used before
its use among Arabs.^5 He further tried to trace its usage back to the Mosaic
period, and by Talmudic times its chain assumed enormous length. Whether the
isnaad system really goes back to Mosaic times is open to doubt, as Horovitz did
not prove that they were not later interpolations. It has also been noted that the
isnaad system was used by the Indians long before Islaam. Occasional use can be
found in ancient Hindu, Buddhist and Jain literature. In the great epic, the
Mahabharta, it states: ‘Vysda composed it, Ganesa seved as a scribe, and the
work was handed down by Vaisampayana, who communicated it to the king

Janamejaya. Sauti, who was present at the time, heard it and narrated it to the
assembly of sages.’^6

However, wherever the isnaad originated, there is no doubt that having
adopted the system, Muslims came to consider the isnaad an indispensable part of
the hadeeths and developed it. They gave it a firm foundation by introducing the
chronological method, assembling biographies of the transmitters, and
establishing a science for determining the value of its contents and the
authenticity of its channel of transmission. The ancient Indians, as far as is
known, never made any attempt at a rigorous and consistent treatment of the
isnaad, nor did they develop the chronological method. Likewise, Jewish
literature had no usage of the chronological method thereby rendering their
isnaads valueless. In fact, Professor Horovitz, himself, admitted that, ‘In the
Talmudic literature there is no idea of chronological method, and the oldest extant
work attempting such an arrangement was composed after 885 AD – more than a
century later than the earliest Islamic work on isnaad-critique. From this fact,’ he
goes on to say, ‘and from the fact that the important Jewish works [of this period]
had been composed in the Islamic dominions, it may be inferred that this
historical interest was due to the Islamic influence.’^7

The practice of specifying the isnaad, not only of the hadeeths but also the
books in which they were collected, was of immense value in preserving the
integrity of books in an age in which printing was unknown, and the creation of
spurious and distorted works was a relatively easy task. The scholarly practice of
certification seems to be unique in the world’s literary history, just as hadeeth
literature is unique in employing a thorough and systematic method of source
identification. Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Syriac manuscripts rarely, if ever, supply
us with such a wealth of information about a book’s origin and use.

The isnaad system, while originating in connection with the hadeeth literature,
was in due course extended by Arab authors to many other genres, including
geography, history, and prose fiction.^8

EVOLUTION OF THE SANAD

Teaching the Sunnah : The Era of the Prophet (r)

(^6) Mahabharata, Book I, canto 1; cf. Winternitz, History of Indian Literature (Calcutta, 1927CE),
I, 323 quoted in Hadith Literature, pp. 78-9.
(^7) Alter und Ursprund des Isnad, 47. Quoted in Hadith Literature, p. 81.
(^8) Hadith Literature, p. 82-3.


Anything which the Prophet of Islaam (r) said or did is considered to be a part of
his Sunnah (i.e. way), which represents the practical application of Islaam
according to divine guidance.

The Prophet (r) used to encourage his Sahaabah^9 to learn and memorize his
Sunnah in many different ways. Sometimes he would sit them down and have
them repeat after him certain Du _‘_ aas^10 which he wanted them to memorize, the
same way he would have them learn the Qur’aan. On other occasions he would
repeat himself three times so that they could memorize his more significant
statements. Sometimes he would give rites were to be performed, then he would
tell them to do it as he had done it. At other times, he would have some of the
Sahaabah record in writing some more complicated things.

The Era of the Sahaabah

After the death of the Prophet (r), the older Sahaabah began to teach the
younger Sahaabah the sayings and practices of the Prophet (r) which they had
not been around to hear or observe. Both the younger and the older Sahaabah used
to teach those who had accepted Islaam during the last days of the Prophet’s life,
and thus never had an opportunity to learn anything directly from the Prophet
(r).

When Islaam spread all over Arabia and into Syria, Iraq, Persia and Egypt
during the reign of the Righteous Caliphs, the Sahaabah began to teach those
who newly entered Islaam the principles of the religion. They would say to those
who gathered around them, “I saw the Prophet do this,” or “I heard the Prophet
say that.” This was how the chain of narration of the Sunnah began. Those new
Muslims who studied under the Sahaabah were later referred to as the Taabi‘oon.

Most of the Taabi _‘_ oon used to memorize and record the statements of the
Prophet (r) which the Sahaabah used to quote. They used to travel to different
parts of the Muslim world of that time in order to learn as much of the Sunnah of
the Prophet (r) from as many of the Sahaabah as possible.

Why All This Effort?

(^9) Anyone who saw Prophet Muhammad (r) and died in a state of Islaam is called a Sahaabee (pl.
Sahaabah), meaning a companion, even if he was a child.
(^10) Informal prayers.


It is natural that people try to watch and remembers the sayings and deeds of
anyone who is dear to them, and there is no doubt that Prophet Muhammad (r)
was the most beloved person on earth to his followers. The Prophet (r) himself
had enjoined this love on his community saying, “None of you has truly believed
until I become more dear to him than this son, his father and all of mankind. _”_^11

Allaah, in the Qur’aan, emphasized for the whole of the Muslim Ummah the
extreme importance of the Sunnah of the Prophet (r) by ordering them to obey
all of his commands:

```
“ Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatever he forbids
you, leave it. ”
Soorah al-Hashr (59): 7
```
How could the Muslim Nation obey this divine command after the Prophet’s

death? How could they know what Allaah’s Messenger (r) had commanded and
forbidden if he was no longer with them? Therefore, great care had to be taken to
preserve the Sunnah and convey it to each successive generations of Muslims.
The Prophet (r) also stressed the great importance of passing on the Sunnah
without any alterations by promising them Allaah’s blessings saying, “Allaah
blesses any man who hears a saying of mine, memorizes it and understands it,
then conveys just as he heard it ; for perhaps one who is informed has more
understanding than the one who heard it. _”_^12 He also stressed it by warning them
of the severe punishment awaiting anyone who lies on him saying “Whoever lies
on me will find his seat in the Hellfire!”^13

The Era of the Taabi‘oon

When the Sahaabah began to die out and Islaam spread into India,
Afghanistan, Russia, China, North Africa and Spain, the Taabi _‘_ oon took up where
the Sahaabah had left off and began the great task of teaching the new converts to

Daawood (Sunan Abu Dawud (English Trans.), vol.3, p.1036, no.3643.


Islaam the principles of the religion. They would say to those who gathered
around them, “I heard such and such a Sahaabee say that he saw the Prophet (r)
do this,” or, “I heard such and such a Sahaabee say that he heard the Prophet (r)
say that.” In this way the second link in the chain of narration of the Sunnah was
added.

Those who studied under the Taabi _‘_ oon were later called Atbaa _‘_ at-Taabi _‘_ een
(followers of the followers). Many of these new students used to travel for days
or even months to meet and study under various Taabe _‘_ oon, taking great care in
the memorization and the writing down of their teacher’s narrations.

During this period, the righteous caliph, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abdul ‘Azeez (reign
717-719) (reign 717-719), commanded all the great scholars of that time, like Abu
Bakr ibn Hazm (d. 737) and Sa‘d ibn Ibraaheeem, to collect all the statements and

actions of the Prophet (r) which were bring taught because some people in Iraq
had begun to make up stories about the Prophet (r). One of the first scholars
among the Taabi _‘_ oon to record the narrations about the Prophet (r) was
Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn Shihaab az-Zuhree. Ibn Shihaab not only recorded
the statements, but also the names of the narrators and information about them so
that those who were making up Hadeeths could be easily identified.

Even though the process of writing down Hadeeths had begun on a large
scale, the oral transmission of Hadeeths continued because much more could be
conveyed in a shorter period of time. Writing was a slow and tedious process in
those days. Writing materials were scare and the printing press had not been
invented.

So the Atbaa _‘_ at-Taabi _‘_ een taught those who gathered around them much in
the same way in which they were taught themselves. They would say to their
students, “I heard such and such a Taabi _‘_ ee say that he heard such and such a
Sahaabee say that he saw the Prophet (r) do this,” or “I heard such and such a
Taabi _‘_ ee say that he heard such and such a Sahaabee say that he heard the
Prophet (r) say that.” Only a few books of Hadeeth from the time of the Atbaa _‘_
at-Taabi _‘_ een have reached us. The most famous of them is the book of Maalik ibn
Anas called Al-Muwatta, and the most famous copy of Al-Muwatta is that of
Maalik’s student Yahyaa ibn Yahyaa from the Berber tribe of Masmoodah.

In the second volume of Yahyaa’s copy of Al-Muwatta, in the chapter on the
Dabb (lizard), we find the following: “Maalik told me from Ibn Shihaab from Abu
Umaamah ibn Sahl (ibn Hurayf) from _‘_ Abdullaah ibn _‘_ Abbaas from Khaalid ibn
al-Waleed that he accompanied the Prophet (r) to his wife Maymoonah _’_ s house
and a roasted Dabb was brought for him (to eat)... so Allaah _’_ s Messenger
stretched out his hand to eat some of it. Some of the women who were with


Maymoonah said, _‘_ Inform Allaah _’_ s Messenger of what he is about to eat. _’_ When
he was told that it was Dabb, he removed his hand from it and (Khaalid ibn al-
Waleed) asked, _‘_ Is it Haraam, O Messenger of Allaah? _’_ He replied , _‘_ No, but it
wasn _‘_ t in my people _’_ s land and I find it loathsome. _’_ Khaalid then said, _‘_ I then
tore off (a piece of) it and ate it whole the Prophet (r) watched me. _’”_^14

The Sanad (chain of transmission) of this Hadeeth is as follows :

(^) Prophet (r)^
Sahaabah
Khaalid
Sahaabah
Ibn ‘Abbaas
Sahaabah
Abu Umaamah
Taabi _‘_ oon

Yahyaa
Khaalid ibn al-Waleed, Ibn ‘Abbaas and Abu Umaamah were all Sahaabah, but
Ibn ‘Abbaas was a young Sahaabee and Abu Umaamah only saw the Prophet (r)
just before his death. So Khaalid related this incident to Ibn ‘Abbaas when he
asked him about eating Dabb and Ibn ‘Abbaas related it to Abu Umaamah who
then told Ibn Shihaab who told Maalik, who in turn wrote it down and told
Yahyaa
Following that hadeeth is another narration on the same topic : “Maalik
informed me from _‘_ Abdullaah ibn Deenar from Ibn _‘_ Umar that a man called out
to the Prophet of Allaah, _‘_ O Prophet of Allaah, what do you say about Dabb? _’_
The Prophet of Allaah replied, _‘_ I don _’_ t eat it and I don _’_ t forbid it. _”_^15
In this case the Sanad is shorter because the Sahaabee Ibn ‘Umar related it
directly to his student Ibn Deenar.

```
3.4 CLASSIFICATION OF HADEETH
```
_Hadeeth_ are divided into two main categories: _Hadeeth Saheeh_ and _Hadeeth
Da‘eef._

The Hadeeth Saheeh

```
If all of the narrators in the Sanad fulfill the following three conditions, the
```
_Hadeeth_ is classified as an accurate saying or action of the Prophet (r) and
named _Saheeh._ This means that we can be certain that the Prophet (r) actually
said or did what was reported in the _Hadeeth._

(1) The narrators must all be known to be truthful.

(2) They must all have had good memories, or have written down what they
heard.^1

(3) They must all have met each other.

Such a _Hadeeth_ can be used to prove a point of Islamic Law which should be
followed. The _Hadeeth_ are the second most important source of Islamic Law and
all true Muslims must follow them. Allaah in the Qur’aan said,

**فﹶانتهوا هعن نهاكﹸم وما فﹶخذﹸوه الرسولﹸ آتاكﹸم وما**

```
“Whatever the messenger give you, you should accept and whatever
he forbids you, you should reject.”
```
The only way that we can follow that command of God is to learn the _Hadeeth_ of
the Prophet (r) and put them into practice.

The _Hadeeth_ mentioned at the beginning of the chapter is a _Hadeeth Saheeh_
which teaches Muslims about Faith ( _Eemaan_ ). True belief in God will cause the
believer to treat others well especially their brothers in faith. Human beings

(^1) Scholars later graded the memories of narrators into excellent and acceptable. If all had excellent
memories the _Hadeeth_ was rated _Saheeh,_ and if some were acceptable it was rated _Hasan._
However, both categories are considered authentic.


naturally want to be treated nicely, as such, good treatment is an important part of
a comfortable and pleasant life. It develops love, trust, respect and many other
good characteristics among people. In order to establish good human relations,
Islaam encourage Muslims to treat others in the same good manner in which they
would like to be treated by others.

Al-Bukhaaree collected from Muhammad ibn al-Muthannaa, from ‘Abdul-
Wahhaab, from Ayyoob from Abu Qailaabah, from Maalik that the Prophet (r)
said, _“Pray as you have seen me praying.”_^2 This _Hadeeth_ fulfills the above-
mentioned conditions and is therefore _Saheeh._ The point of Islamic law in it is
that in formal prayer ( _Salaah_ ) we must follow the method used by the Prophet
(r). Muslims are not allowed to make up their own personal style of prayer, as it
is not only disobedience to the Prophet (r) but it will also lead to confusion in the

prayer lines. The correct description of the Prophet’s (r) _Salaah_ can be found in
the books of _Hadeeth._ So we must read and find out how the Prophet (r) prayed
in order to follow him properly.

The Hadeeth Da‘eef

If any of the narrators in the _Sanad_ were known to have had any of the
following faults, the _Hadeeth_ is then classified as being inaccurate and referred to
as _Da‘eef._

If any were known to have been liars.

If any were known to have had bad memories.

If any were known to have not met the one he was supposed to be narrating from.

The _Hadeeth Da‘eef_ is not a true saying or action of the Prophet (r) and
cannot be used to prove any point of Islamic Law. Any law which is based on
such a _Hadeeth_ is considered incorrect. For example, _Hadeeth_ scholars Abu
Daawood and Ahmad collected a narration from Hafs ibn Ghayyaath who
reported from ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Is-haaq from Ziyaad ibn Zayd from Abu
Juhayfah that ‘Alee ibn Abee Taalib was supposed to have said, “The _Sunnah_
position of hands in _Salaah_ is to place on hand on the other hand, below the
navel.”^3 However, this _Hadeeth_ is classified as _Da‘eef_ in the sub-category of

(^2) _Sahih Al-Bukhari_ (Arabic-English), vol.1, p.345, no.604.
(^3) _Sunan Abu Dawud_ (English Trans.), vol.1, p.194, no.756.


_mawdoo‘_ (fabricated) because ‘Abdur-Rahmaan was a known liar. Therefore, it
can not be used to support the practice of placing one’s hands below the navel in
_Salaah._ The correct practice is as _Taawoos_ reported in another _Hadeeth_ which is
_Saheeh._ He said that Allaah’s Messenger (r) used to put his right hand on his left
hand and place them on his chest whenever he was in _Salaah._^4 This _Hadeeth_ was
also collected by Abu Daawood and Ahmad as well as Ibn Khuzaymah. Of
course, the placing of one’s hands below the navel or on the navel does not ruin
one’s _Salaah._

Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ateeyah reported from Abu ‘Aatikah from Anas that the
Prophet (r) said, “Seek knowledge even in China.” This _Hadeeth_ was collected
by the _Hadeeth_ scholars Ibn ‘Adee and Abu Nu‘aym. Although it is commonly
quoted _Hadeeth_ which is well known among Muslims, it is not accurate. Abu
‘Aatikah was accused of falsifying _Hadeeths,_ thus this narration is classified as
_Da‘eef._ In fact, _Hadeeth_ scholars have put it in a special category of _Da‘eef
Hadeeths_ called _Mawdoo‘_ (fabricated). Consequently it is incorrect to quote this
statement as a _Hadeeth_ of the Prophet (r), because many of his companions have
quoted him as saying, _“Let whoever deliberately lies about me take his seat in the
Hellfire.”_^5

The most famous books of _Hadeeths_ are called “the Sound Six” ( _as-Sihaah as-
Sittah_ ). They are Saheeh al-Bukhaaree, Saheeh Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawood,
Sunan at-Tirmithee, Sunan an-Nasaa’ee and Sunan Ibn Maajah. The oldest
collection of _Hadeeths_ to reach us is the _Muwatta’_ of Maalik and the largest
collection of _Hadeeths_ is the _Musnad_ of Ahmad. The most accurate collection of
_Hadeeths_ is that of al-Bukhaaree and the second most accurate is that of Muslim.
The most accurate collection of _Hadeeths_ is that of al Bukhaaree and the second
most accurate is that of Muslim. That is, one may freely quote _Hadeeths_ from
both the Saheehs of al Bukhaaree and Muslim as evidence, because they are very
nearly all authentic. However, the other books of _Hadeeths_ contain a number of
inaccurate narrations which cannot be used as evidence. Therefore, only the
_Hadeeths_ which have been rated accurate by the scholars may be used from the
other books. It should also be noted that most modern books only mention the last
narrator before the Prophet (r) when quoting _Hadeeth_ is order to save time and
space.

are according to their intentions and every person will have what he intended.

This hadeeth is so comprehensive, touching almost all aspects of Islaam that
Imaam Aboo Daawood said it was half of Islaam. That is, Islaamic knowledge is
composed of apparent deeds and the intentions behind them. Imaam ash-Shaafi‘ee
was of the opinion that it comprises one third of knowledge, which according to
al-Bayhaqee meant that people earn reward with their hearts, tongues and bodies
and intention is involved with one of them.^3 Imaam Ahmad expressed that Islaam
revolves around three hadeeths: “Indeed actions are according to their
intentions,” “Whoever introduces anything into this affair of ours that is not from
it will have it rejected,” and “The permissible is clear and the forbidden is clear.”^4

Context of the Hadeeth

In many cases, there are circumstances in which various statements of the
Prophet (r) or his acts were done. Knowledge of these contexts help to clarify the
intended meaning of the hadeeths. If there is no recorded information about a
hadeeth _’_ s context, the general meaning is taken and the hadeeth is studied in the
context of the relevant Qur’aanic verses and hadeeths. In this case the Prophet’s
companion Ibn Mas‘ood was of the opinion that the statement in this hadeeth was
made concerning a man who wanted to marry Umm Qays. When she refused him
unless he migrated from Makkah to Madeenah, he did so in order to marry her
and was nick-named “the migrant for Umm Qays”.

The Narrator

‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (583-644CE) is considered to be the greatest
companion of the Prophet (r) after Aboo Bakr. The Prophet (r) prayed that
Allaah would strengthen Islaam during the Makkan period by his conversion.
With his conversion, five years before the Hijrah (migration to Madeenah),
Muslims had the confidence to pray openly after praying secretly for eight years
prior to that.^5 The Prophet (r) mentioned him among ten of his followers whom
he promised paradise and praised his courage and knowledge.

He was the second of what came to be known as the Four Righteous
Caliphs, who lead the Muslim state after the Prophet’s death. During his reign,
Muslims defeated the Persian and Roman empires and the rule of Islaam spread
from Iran to Egypt.

There are over 530 hadeeths narrated by ‘Umar in the books of hadeeth
and he was known for his concern to ensure the authenticity of whatever was
narrated from the Prophet (r).

Meaning of “ _Indeed actions are according to their intentions..._ ”

The term intention (niyyah) refers to one’s resolve to do something as long as
nothing prevents it or one’s intention does not change. Jurists refer to the intention

(^5) The commonly quoted story of his conversion in which he was reported to have hit sister in her
head and later read a portion of the Qur’aan is not authentic.


as “the intent in the heart that must accompany and precede any act of worship.”^6
A person may state that his or her intent is something and intend something else
in their heart. Consequently, the place of the intention is in the heart as held by
most scholars. Furthermore, it was not the practice of the Prophet (r) to express
his intention out loud before any acts except Hajj.

The first part of the Prophet’s statement addresses the fact that every
intentional act done by a rational person has behind it an intent, without which the
act would not have been done. The intention may be good and pious, or it may be
evil, or it may be religiously neutral. The value of deeds is determined by the
intentions behind them. Three people may do the same act with three different
intentions as is explained by the remainder of the Prophet’s statement. One may
emigrate with the intention of pleasing Allaah and obedience to His Messenger
(r), and another may accompany him with the sole intention of marrying a
woman or some other worldly purpose, and yet another may accompany them in
order to assassinate the Prophet (r). Externally their acts resemble each other but
their internal intentions will determine the real value of their deeds. The act of
hijrah was primarily a religious act. The deed of one who did so for the correct
intention will be counted as a righteous deed of emigration which will make him
eligible for a reward from God. In the second case, the intention of marriage was
not evil, but it was wrong for that act, consequently, his emigration would not be
considered a righteous deed and he would not be eligible for any reward. In the
third case, the emigrant had an evil intent thus not only would he not be eligible
for reward, but also it would be considered an evil deed for which he could be
punished.

Any act done with the sole intention of pleasing Allaah which is according
to the sharee _‘_ ah is considered an act of worship or _‘_ ibaadah. Those acts that are
purely worship must be accompanied with an intention for them to be acceptable
to God. Among them, according to the majority opinion among jurists, are wudoo,
ghusl, tayammum, salaah, zakaah, sawm, hajj, i _‘_ tikaaf. For example, the Prophet
(r) said:

**لﹶه صِيام فﹶلاﹶ اللَّ يلِ مِن الصيام يبيتِ لﹶم من**

“One who does not make the intention to fast during the night of Ramadaan (for
the next day) will not be rewarded for the fast.”^7

(^6) Commentary on the Forty Hadith of al-Nawawi, p. 123.
(^7) Sunan an-Nasaa _’_ ee, vol. , p. , no. , and authenticated in Saheeh al-Jaami _‘_ , vo. 2, p. 1114.


If a person did not eat due to an illness or a lack of food, it could not be counted
as fasting from a religious perspective. The act of fasting must be preceded by the
intention for it to be acceptable to God. Therefore, intentions are one means of
distinguishing between non-religious acts and religious acts. They also distinguish
between obligatory and voluntary acts of worship.

Intention is one of the deeds of the heart which are under human control
and is a result of personal choice. Consequently, humans are instructed to make
their intentions pure and to define their purposes. They are prohibited from
committing shirk in their intentions and from deviating their intentions to
prohibited acts. Were intentions not under human control, the divine order to have
purity of intention and to avoid shirk would be an obligation which human beings
could not fulfill.^8

The Spanish jurist Ibn Hazm stated, “Intention is the secret of servitude
and its spirit. Its place, with respect to deeds, is like the soul with respect to the
body. It is inconceivable to consider a deed of servitude that is not accompanied
with its soul. In that case, it is like a dilapidated body.”^9 Purity of intention
distinguishes between worshipping Allaah correctly and worshipping Him
incorrectly, and as such should be the ultimate goal and purpose of human beings.
This is verified in Allaah’s statement:

```

“ They were only commanded to worship Allaah making the religion

(Soorah al-Bayyinah, :5)
```
It should be noted that there are some deeds which do not need intention for their
validity. For example, cleaning one’s clothing from ritual impurities is a
precondition for formal prayer. If one cleaned it along with other items without

(^8) Al-Ghazzaalee’s in Ihyaa _‘_ Uloom ad-Deen quotes stories of early scholars in they stated how
difficult it was for them to develop correct intention and how some would refrain from acting for
days until their intention was present for certain deeds. If they are authentic quotes, they can only
be taken as personal accounts and not the basis for principles of faith. Al-Ghazzaalee concluded
that humans “cannot create this drive or make it appear in” themselves and Ibn Khaldoon also
stated that most people do not have control over the intention of most of their actions (Muqaasid,
p. 40).
(^9) Quoted in Muqaasid, p. 68-9.


intending to clean it for worship, it would still be considered ritually pure and
may be used for worship.

On the other hand an act might be fundamentally religiously neutral
(mubaah), meaning - according to jurists - that there is no reward or punishment
for one who does it or does not do it. However, it may be turned into an act of
worship eligible for reward if it is done because it was permissible – while
avoiding the forbidden – and or as a means of coming closer to God. To that
effect the Prophet (r) stated the following: “Anything you spend seeking Allaah _’_ s
Countenance will be rewarded, even for [the bit of food] that you put in your
wife _’_ s mouth.”^10

Ibn al-Qayyim wrote in his classic, Madaarij as-Saalikeen, “The most
exclusive [group of] people who become close to Allaah are those who change the
nature of their permissible acts into deeds of obedience to Allaah.” He also wrote,
“The customary deeds of those people who truly know Allaah are acts of worship
[for them] while the ritual acts of worship are customary deeds for the masses.”^11
The masses of Muslims approach prayers, fasting and other religious deeds as
common daily practices that they must do because it is part of their culture. Most
of them have no strong intention in their hearts of doing acts of worship for the
sake of Allaah. If the quality of the act is poor, it does not matter much to them
because they are doing it just to finish.

Righteous deeds done for show are cursed and the Prophet (r) labeled
them as “hidden shirk” (ash-Shirk al-Khafee or ash-Shirk al-Asghar) and warned
against it severely as the thing he feared the most for his followers.

Where intentions are mixed between God and others, Allaah also rejects them
according to the Prophet’s quote from Allaah, “I am so self-sufficient that I am in
no need of having an associate. Therefore, anyone who does a deed for someone
else _’_ s sake as well as for My sake will have the deed left to the one he associated
with Me.”^12 In that respect, Ibn Rajab stated, “I know of no difference of opinion
on this point among the Salaf although some later scholars did differ on this
point.”^13

On the other hand, if someone does a religious act for the pleasure of Allaah
and people praise him for it, his reward will not be affected. When the Prophet

(^11) Mabaahith fee an-Niyyah, p. 15.
(^12) Sahih Muslim, vol. , p. , no..
(^13) Jaami _‘_ , vol. , p..


(r) was asked about one who did that he replied, “That is a prompt part of the
good tidings that the believer receives.”^14

Intentions beyond Actions

The actions of the heart can take one beyond the bounds of physical deeds.
That is, a person may be rewarded for having the intention to do a deed which
they never got the opportunity to do. During the Prophet’s era, a man prepared for
jihad but died before being able to do so. His daughter said to him, “I wish you
could have died a martyr, for you had prepared for it.” The Prophet (r) informed
her, “Indeed Allaah, Most Great and Glorious, has given his reward to him
according to his intention.”^15

Consequently, when women are disallowed from making Hajj due to not
having a mahram^16 for their protection, they should not feel denied and end up
making Hajj anyway. For their sincere desire to make Hajj may earn them far
greater rewards than many who actually make the Hajj. And they should not
forget that most Muslims never get the opportunity to make Hajj in their lifetimes
due to economic reasons.

Meaning of “ _and every person will have what he intended._ ”

This part of the Prophet’s statement may be considered as emphasis for the
first part, “Indeed actions are according to their intentions,” which stressed the
importance of purity of intention (ikhlaas) and warned against doing religious acts
for show or for other wrong intentions.^17 Or it may be considered the consequence
and the first part the cause. That is, in the first part, the Prophet (r) made it clear
that every deed must have an intention behind it. In the second part he informed
that reward and punishment will be in accordance with the intention. If one
intended the pleasure of Allaah and the Hereafter in his or her religious deeds,
that will be the consequence. While those who intend the fleeting pleasures of this
world may be given it or they may not.^18 As Allaah said:

son, uncle, grandfather, etc.).

Nawawi, p. 133).

```
“ For whoever desires the transitory enjoyment of this world, I will
promptly grant of it what I wish and to whom I wish... ” (Soorah al-
Israa, :)
```
This part of the Prophet’s statement could also mean that the reward for deeds
depends solely on the nature of the intentions behind them. With regard to this,
Ibn Rajab said, “...[It] is a statement about the sharee _‘_ ah ruling. That is, the only
portion belonging to the doer from his deed is his intention. If it was sound or
pious, his deed is sound and he will have its reward. If it was evil, then his deed
was evil and he will carry its burden... [Thus,] the first sentence indicates that the
goodness or evilness of an act is according to the intention that brought it into
being. The second sentence indicates that the reward for the doer for his deed is
according to his pious intention and his punishment for his deed is based on his
evil intention.”^19 Al-Ashqar also wrote in this regard, “The truth to which the
Qur’aan and Sunnah testify is that the real thing that is made obliged by the
sharee _‘_ ah rulings is the person’s soul. The body is just a tool for it. If a deed is
without what the soul has been ordered to fulfill – which is purity of intention –
than the deed that the body performs is a type of useless play and straying.”^20

When the Prophet (r) stated that everyone would get what they intended,
he meant that their reward or punishment in the next life would be according to
what they intended, not literally that their intent would be fulfilled in this life.
Because most people do not get whatever they intend in this world. If the person’s
intent was for the sake of Allaah, then he or she earns Allaah’s pleasure and His
reward. If the person’s intention was religiously neutral, the result will also be
religiously neutral though it may not be exactly what the person intended. And if
the person had an evil intent, the result will ultimately be evil; not what they
intended but according to what they intended.

Meaning of “ _So, whoever’s migration (_ hijrah _) was for Allaah and His
Messenger, then his migration is for Allaah and His Messenger..._ ”

The word hijrah literally means “to leave a place of abode and emigrate to
another people; from one land, district or town to another.”^21 However, from the
sharee _‘_ ah perspective it means “to emigrate from the territory of disbelievers to

(^19) Jaami _‘_ , vol. 1, pp. 64-5.
(^20) Muqaasid, p. 69.
(^21) Arabic-English Lexicon, p. 2880.


the territory of the believers or to any place of safety or refuge on account of
religious persecution.”^22 During the Prophet’s lifetime there were two hijrahs.
The first was from Makkah to Abyssinia around the fifth year of the prophethood
and the second was from Makkah to Madeenah in the thirteenth year. In the first
hijrah a small band of Muslims who were able to escape persecution in Makkah
sought refuge with the ruler of Ethiopia at the Prophet’s suggestion and they
remained there until the time of the second hijrah. When the Prophet (r)
emigrated to Madeenah, it became obligatory on all Muslims to join him there. In
this regard Allaah revealed the verse:

```
“ Indeed those whom the angels take in a state of self-oppression will
be asked, ‘ In what condition were you? ’ They will reply, ‘ We were
weak and oppressed in the land. ’ They will be asked, ‘ Wasn ’ t
Allaah ’ s earth spacious enough for you to emigrate? ’ Such people
will find their abode in Hell – what an evil destination. ” (Soorah an-
Nisaa, 4:97)
```
Once Makkah was conquered that obligation was removed with regard to
Madeenah as the Prophet (r) said: “There is no hijrah after the Conquest of
Makkah, but what remains is jihaad and intention.”^23 Although it is this hijrah
which this hadeeth seems to refer to, the text is general and there is no authentic
evidence to limit it. Furthermore, hijrah as a principle remains an obligation on all
Muslims until the Last Day, as indicted in the Prophet’s saying, “Hijrah will not
end until repentance ends. And repentance will not end until the sun rises from
the West.”^24 The object of hijrah is to shift one’s residence to a location in which
one can best practice Islaam. On that basis, scholars have categorized the different
types of hijrah as follows:

1. Hijrah from the land of disbelief (Daar al-Kufr) to the land of Islaam (Daar
    al-Islaam).
2. Hijrah from a land of bid _‘_ ah (heresy and innovation).
3. Hijrah from a land dominated by haraam to one less dominated.
4. Hijrah from a land where one’s life or limb, health, or property is threatened.

(^22) Ibid.
(^23) Sahih Al Bukhari, vol. 4, p. 35, no. 42; Sahih Muslim, vol. 3, p. 1038, no. 4599.

vol. 2, p. 470, no. 2473.


5. Hijrah from whatever Allaah has prohibited.^25

Consequently, those who make hijrah for the sake of their religion will be
rewarded on the basis of that pious intention even if they die before achieving
their goal. Allaah indicated that saying:

```
“ Whoever leaves his home emigrating to Allaah and His Messenger
and death over takes him, his reward is incumbent on Allaah. ”
(Soorah an-Nisaa, 4:100)
```
This segment of the hadeeth is a prophetic example of deeds being counted and
rewarded according to their intentions. Even if the end result is not what is
intended, the reward will be based on the intent as in the above-mentioned verse.
On one occasion a man gave some charity for distribution and it was in turn given
to his son. When he told the Prophet (r) that he had not desired that, he was
informed, “For you is what you intended,” and his son was told, “For you is what
you have received.”^26 The Prophet (r) repeated or restated “Allaah and His
Messenger” in order to emphasize the importance and greatness of the purpose of
the migration. The goal of “Allaah and His Messenger” is the ultimate goal of
intentions for this life and the next. Furthermore, it is a singular goal which cannot
be mixed with any other. Whereas the reasons for worldly goals are too numerous
to count so “for whatever he migrated” suffices.^27

It has also been noted that by using “for them” instead of “for Allaah and His
Messenger” would refer to Allaah and His Messenger with a single pronoun,
which is inappropriate. On one occasion, when a person said, “Whoever obeys
Allaah and His Messenger has indeed been guided. And whoever disobeys them
has strayed,” the Prophet (r) corrected him and told him to say instead, “Whoever
disobeys Allaah and His Messenger.”^28

Meaning of “ _And whoever’s migration was for this world or a
woman for marriage, then his migration is for what he migrated._ ”

The Prophet (r) belittled the goal of the person who migrated for worldly
goals by not repeating what he previously mentioned. Migration for economic
betterment from one Islaamic environment to another equally Islaamic
environment is permissible according to sharee _‘_ ah. When a person emigrates for

(^25) The Prophet (r) said, “The one who truly makes hijrah is one who avoids what Allaah has
prohibited.” Sahih Al Bukhari, vol. 1, p. 18, no. 9.
(^26) Sahih Al Bukhari, vol. , p. , no..
(^27) Jaami _‘_ , vol. 1, p. 73.
(^28) Sahih Muslim, vol. , p. , no..


material gain from a relatively Islaamic to a non-Islaamic environment, it
becomes haraam. In doing so, he puts his own Islaam at risk as well as the
religion of his family. His hijrah is cursed and his family is likely to be spiritually
and socially destroyed.

Marriage is specifically mentioned in the closing statement, even it though
it is a part of worldly goals, because of the great danger that women – or the
opposite sex in general – pose to piety and righteousness. Allaah warned about the
danger of spouses saying:

```
“ Indeed there is in your spouses and children a trial, so beware of
them. ”
```
The Prophet (r) also said, “Indeed the world is sweet and alluring and Allaah is
going to make you successors in it. So look and see how you behave. Beware of
this world and beware of women. For, certainly the first trial that afflicted the
Israelites was concerning women.”^29 He further said, “I have not left any trial
after me more harmful to men than women.”^30

The trial of women is evident from the numerous cases of sexual scandal
involving leading political figures like Bill Clinton, former president of the United
States of America, to leading religious figures like televangelist Jimmy Swaggart.
People are commonly trapped into spying for other counties using women. Many
religious cults like the Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Moonies commonly use
females to recruit members. Commercially, goods are often promoted using
fashion models.

Intentions and Deeds

Ibn ‘Ajlaan said, “A deed is not useful unless accompanied by three
factors: awareness of Allaah; good intention; and correctness of the deed.”^31

Ash-Shaatibee divided all acts into four categories:

1. The intent and the act are both consistent with the sharee _‘_ ah. These are the
    basic conditions of a righteous deed.
2. The intent and the act contradict the sharee _‘_ ah. This represents one of the
    forms of sin where the intent is sinful and the act itself is sinful.

(^29) Ibid., vol. , p. , no..
(^30) Sahih Al Bukhari, vol. , p. , no. ; Sahih Muslim, vol. , p. , no..
(^31) Jaami _‘_ , vol. 1, p. 71.


3. The intent is wrong but the act is consistent.

```
a) The person had a sinful intent, but was unaware that his act was in
accordance with the sharee ‘ ah. For example, a person borrows an audio
cassette with the intent of listening to music only to find that it is a
recording of Qur’aan.
b) The person’s intent is evil and he is aware that his act was in agreement
with the sharee ‘ ah. For example, a person who does not normally cover
herself, puts on the complete Islaamic garb when attending Islaamic
gatherings. This is an act of hypocrisy (nifaaq).
```
4. The intent is correct but the act is inconsistent.

```
a) The person has the correct intent but is aware that his act contradicts the
sharee ‘ ah. Most forms of bid ‘ ah fall under this category, like celebrating
the Prophet’s birthday. Likewise, the principle of “the ends justifies the
mean,” where people commit sins with good intentions belongs under this
category.
b) The person’s intent is correct but is unaware that his act is inconsistent
with the sharee ‘ ah. Such an act is a genuine mistake for which a person
may still be rewarded. No sin would be written against him as in the case
of forgetfulness.
```

```
4.1 FIQH AND SHAREE‘AH
```
Fiqh has been loosely translated into English as _“_ Islamic law _”_ and so has
Sharee _‘_ ah but these terms are not synonymous either in the Arabic language or to
the Muslim scholar.

Fiqh literally means, the true understanding of what is intended. An
example of this usage can be found in the Prophet Muhammad’s statement: “To
whomsoever Allaah wishes good, He gives the Fiqh (true understanding) of the
Religion. _”_^1 Technically, however, Fiqh refers to the science of deducing Islamic
laws from evidence found in the sources of Islamic law. By extension it also
means the body of Islamic laws so deduced.

Sharee **_‘_** ah, literally means, a waterhole where animals gather daily to
drink, or the straight path as in the Qur’anic verse,

**علﹶمونﹶي لﹶا الَّ ذِين أﹶهواءَ تتبِع ولﹶا فﹶاتبِعها الﹾأﹶمرِ مِن شرِيعةٍ علﹶى جعلﹾناك ثﹸم**

```
“ Then We put you on a straight path (Sharee ‘ ah) in you affairs, so
follow it and do not follow the desires of those who have no
knowledge. ”^2
```
Islamically, however it refers to the sum total of Islamic laws which were
revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (r), and which are recorded in the Qur’aan as
well as deducible from the Prophet’s divinely-guided lifestyle (called the
Sunnah).^3

The Distinction

From the previous two definitions, the following three differences may be
deduced:

1. Sharee _’_ ah is the body of revealed laws found both in the Qur’aan and in the
Sunnah, while Fiqh is a body of laws deduced from Sharee _‘_ ah to cover
specific situations not directly treated in Sharee _‘_ ah law.

(^1) Reported by Mu‘aawiyah and collected by al-Bukhaaree (Sahih Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English),
vol.4, pp.223-4, no346), Muslim (Abdul Hamid Siddiqi, Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), (Beirut:
Dar al-Arabia, n.d.) vol.3, p.1061, no..4720), at-Tirmidhee and others.

(^3) Muhammad Shalabee, al-Madkhal fee at-Ta _‘_ reef bil-Fiqh al-Islaamee, (Beirut: Daar an-Nahdah
al-Arabeeyah, 1969), p.28.


2. Sharee _‘_ ah is fixed and unchangeable, whereas Fiqh changes according to
the circumstances under which it is applied.
3. The laws of Sharee _‘_ ah are, for the most part, general: the lay down basic
principles. In contrast, the laws of Fiqh tend to be specific: they demonstrate how
the basic principles of Sharee _‘_ ah should be applied in given circumstances.^4

Islamic law is fundamentally based on the main two sources of divine revelation:
the Qur _’_ aan which represents the direct word of God to man, and the Sunnah
which may be called the indirect word of God. Allaah has said in the Qur’aan
concerning the statements of the Prophet Muhammad (r):

يوحى وحي إِلَّ ا هو إِنﹾ( 3 )الﹾهوى عن ينطِق وما

```
“ He (Muhammad) does not speak from his desires. It is nothing but
revelation sent down to him. ”^5
```
The laws contained in these two sources are primary laws which can not be
changed at any time. However, in the understanding and application of these laws,
secondary sources have evolved. The most significant of them to this study of
Usool al-Fiqh are Ijmaa _‘_ , a consensus of opinion, and Qiyaas, the deduction of
rulings by comparison.

Method

If we want to know how we should govern a country, or how we should judge
criminals, as well as settle disputes between people, or even how to run our
families, we should first look in the Qur’aan, to see what Allaah has to say on it
then we should turn to the Sunnah to see what the Prophet (r) did or said related
to the topic. If we can not find what we are looking for, we look to see what
points of law the Sahaabah (Companions of the Prophet (r) agreed on. This area
of agreement is called Ijmaa _‘_. If, after that, we are still unable to find what we are
looking for, we are then allowed to use our own reasoning to come to decision.
This decision should have some support from the Qur’aan, the Sunnah or Ijmaa _‘_ ,
and if it does, it is called Qiyaas.

1. THE QUR **’** AAN

The Qur’aan is the word of Allaah as revealed to His last Prophet, Muhammad
(r), in Arabic rhyme, whose recitation is used in Salaah and other forms of
worship, and whose smallest chapter is a miracle in itself.

Miracle of the Qur’aan

1. Allaah in the Qur’aan challenged the Arabs, as well as all of mankind, saying
    to them,

**مِثﹾلِهِ مِن بِسورةٍ فﹶأﹾتوا عبدِنا علﹶى نزلﹾنا مِما ريبٍ فِي نتمكﹸ إِنﹾ** و

```
“ If you are in doubt about that which We have revealed to Our
servant, bring one Soorah (chapter) similar to it ”^6
```
We all know that the smallest Soorah in the Qur’aan is Soorah al-Kawthar having
only 3 short verses yet, the Arabs at the time when the Qur’aan was revealed were
unable to make one like it.

2. The Qur’aan contains certain scientific facts which were unknown in those
days. For example, Allaah says that the chest of the disbeliever becomes tight as if
he were ascending upwards into the sky,

**السماءِ فِي يصعد كﹶأﹶنما حرجا ضيقﹰا صدره يجعلﹾ يضِلَّ ه أﹶنﹾ يرِد ومن**

```
“ He whom He (Allaah) wills to leave astray, He makes his chest tight
and compressed as if he were ascending up into the sky. ”^7
```
It was only recently that man discovered that the higher up into the
atmosphere he travels, the less oxygen is present. So if one goes up high enough,
he will have difficulty breathing and his chest will feel as if it is tightening due to
the lack of oxygen. Allaah also talks in the Qur’aan about the movement of the
sun and the moon saying that,

(^6) Soorah al-Baqarah, (2):23.
(^7) Soorah al-An‘aam, (6):125.


**يسبحونﹶ فﹶلﹶكٍ فِي كﹸلٌّ والﹾقﹶمر والشمس والنهار اللَّ يلﹶ خلﹶق الَّ ذِي وهو**

```
“ It is He who created the night and day, the sun and the moon, all of
them are floating in orbits. ”^8
```
Man only a few years ago found out that the moon travels around the earth in
an orbit. As for the Sun, they now admit that it is moving within the Milky Way
Galaxy which is itself moving in space also. But as of yet, they have not
determined the exact pattern of its motion. Some feel it is in a straight line while
others feel, it might be circular. There are countless other scientific facts
mentioned in the Qur’aan which were totally unknown 1,400 years ago proving
that it could only have come from the Creator.

3. Allaah also made the Qur’aan very easy to memorize. So easy, that millions
and millions of Muslims have memorized it since its revelation. It is no smaller
than the New Testament which Christians follow, yet no one has been known to
have ever memorized the New Testament.
4. Allaah has protected the Qur’aan from any change at all. From the time it was
revealed until now, it has remained the same. Allaah made a promise in the
Qur’aan at the time of its revelation that He would protect it from change.

```
“ Certainly it is We who revealed the Reminder (Qur ’ aan) and it is
indeed We who will protect it. ”^9
```
If all the other religious books in the world were destroyed, the only book which
could be rewritten exactly as it was, is the Qur’aan.

The Method of Legislation

Sections of the Qur’aan were continuously revealed to the Prophet
Muhammad (r) from the beginning of his prohethood in the year 609 C.E. until
shortly before his death (632 C.E.), a period of approximately twenty-three years.
The various sections of the Qur’aan were generally revealed to solve the problems

(^8) Soorah al-Anbiyaa, (21):33.
(^9) Soorah al-Hijr, (15):9.


which confronted the Prophet (r) and his followers in both Makkah and
Madeenah. A number of Qur’anic verses are direct answers to questions raised by
Muslims as well as non-Muslims during the era of prophethood. Many of these
verses actually begin with the phrase “They ask you about.” For example,

**وكﹸفﹾر اللَّ هِ سبِيلِ عن وصد كﹶبِير فِيهِ قِتالﹲ قﹸلﹾ فِيهِ قِتالٍ الﹾحرامِ الشهرِ عن يسأﹶلﹸونك**

```
“ They ask you about fighting in the forbidden months. Say,
‘ Fighting in them is a grave offense, but blocking Allaah ’ s path and
denying Him is even graver in Allaah ’ s sight. ”^10
```
**مِـن ر أﹶكﹾب وإِثﹾمهما لِلناسِ ومنافِع كﹶبِير إِثﹾم فِيهِما قﹸلﹾ والﹾميسِرِ الﹾخمرِ عن يسأﹶلﹸونك**

**نفﹾعِهِما**

```
“ They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, ‘ There is great evil in
them as well as benefit to man. But the evil is greater than the
benefit. ”^11
```
**الﹾمحِيضِ فِي النساءَ فﹶاعتزِلﹸوا أﹶذﹰى هو قﹸلﹾ الﹾمحِيضِ عن ويسأﹶلﹸونك**

```
“ They ask you about menses. Say, ‘ It is harm, so stay away from
(sexual relations with) women during their menses. ”^12
```
A number of other verses were revealed due to particular incidents which took
place during the era of the Prophet (r). An example can be found in the case of
Hilaal ibn Umayyah who came before the Prophet (r) and accused his wife of
adultery with another of the Prophet’s companions. The Prophet (r) said, _“_ Either
you bring proof (i.e., three other witnesses) or you will receive the fixed
punishment (of eighty lashes) on your back. _”_ Hilaal said, “Oh Messenger of
Allaah! If any of us saw a man on top of his wife, would he go looking for

(^10) Soorah al-Baqarah (2):127.
(^11) Soorah al-Baqarah (2):219.
(^12) Soorah al-Baqarah (2):222.


witnesses?” However, the Prophet (r) repeated his demand for proof. Then angel
Gabriel came and revealed to the Prophet (r) the verse:^13

**أﹶربع أﹶحدِهِم فﹶشهادةﹸ أﹶنفﹸسهم إِلَّ ا شهداءُ لﹶهم ﹸنكي ولﹶم واجهمزأﹶ يرمونﹶ والَّ ذِين**

```
“ As for those who accuse their wives and have no evidence but their
own, their witness can be four declarations with oaths by Allaah that
they are truthful and fifth invoking Allaah ’ s curse on themselves if
they are lying. But the punishment will be averted from the wife if
she bears witness four times with oaths by Allaah that he is lying,
and a fifth oath invoking Allaah ’ s curse on herself if he is telling the
truth. ”^14
```
The same was the case of Islamic legislation found in the Sunnah, much of
which was either the result of answers to questions, or were pronouncements
made at the time that incidents took place. For example, on one occasion, one of
the Prophet’s companions asked him, _“_ Oh Messenger of Allaah! We sail the seas
and if we make Wudoo (ablutions) with our fresh water we will go thirsty. Can we
make Wudoo with sea water? _”_ He replied, _“_ Its water is pure and its dead (sea
creatures) are Halaal (permissible to eat). _”_^15

The reason for this method of legislation was to achieve gradation in the
enactment of laws, as this approach was more easily acceptable by Arabs who
were used to complete freedom. It also made it easier for them to learn and
understand the laws since the reasons and context of the legislation would be
known to them. This method of gradual legislation was not limited to the laws as
a whole, but it also took place during the enactment of a number of individual
laws. The legislation of Salaah (formal prayers) is a good example of gradation in
the enactment of individual laws. In the early Makkan period, Salaah was initially

twice per day, once in the morning and once at night.^16 Shortly before the
migration to Madeenah, five times daily Salaah was enjoined on the believers.
However, Salaah at the time consisted of only two units per prayer, with the
exception of Maghrib (sunset) prayers which were three units. After the early
Muslims had become accustomed to regular prayer, the number of units were
increased to four for residents, except for Fajr (early morning) prayer and that of
Maghrib.^17 ”^18

Qur’anic Fields of Study

The body of information contained in the Qur’aan, as a whole, may be
grouped under three general headings with regards to the fields of study to which
they are related:

First: Information related to Belief in God, His angels, His scriptures His
prophets, and the affairs of the next life. These topics are covered within the field
of study known as theology (‘Ilm al-Kalaam or al- _‘_ Aqeedah).

Second: Information related to deeds of the heart and soul, and moral principles
and rules of conduct aimed at the development of nobility of character. These
areas represent the field of moral science known as ethics ( _‘_ Ilm al-Akhlaaq).

Third: Information related to deeds of the limbs and contained within a body of
commandments, prohibitions and choices.. This group represents the field of
law.^19

Legal Content of the Qur’aan

Islamic legislation in the Qur’aan is comprised of a variety of acts which
have been enjoined by divine decree on mankind. These acts may be grouped in
two basic categories with regard to the parties involved in the acts:

(^16) al-Madkhal, p.74-8.
(^17) See Sahih Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English), vol.1, p.214, no.346.
18 Evolution of Fiqh, pp. 5-8.
(^19) Muhammad al-Khidaree Bek, Taareekh at-Tashree _‘_ al-Islaamee, (Cairo: al-Maktabah at-
Tijaareeyah al-Kubraa, 1960), pp.17-8.


A. Dealings between Allaah and humankind. These are the religious rites which
are not valid without correct intentions. Some of them are purely religious forms
of worship, like prayer and fasting; while others are socio-economic forms of
worship, like Zakaah (compulsory charity); and yet others are socio-physical
forms of worship, like Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah). These four acts of worship
are considered the foundation of Islaam after faith (Eemaan).

B. Dealings among human beings. The laws governing these dealings may
themselves be divided into four sub-sections relative to the subject matter of the
dealings:

```
a) Laws ensuring and defending the propagation of Islaam. These are
embodied in the codes of armed or unarmed struggle (Jihaad).
b) Family laws for the development and protection of the family structure.
These include laws concerning marriage, divorce and inheritance.
c) Trade laws governing business transactions, rental contracts, etc.
d) Criminal laws governing business transactions, rental contracts, various
crimes.^20
```
The Basis of Legislation in the Qur’aan

The Qur’aan itself announces that it was revealed to reform human
conditions. Islaam did not erase all pre-Islamic customs and practises. Instead, it
removed every facet of corruption and cancelled all customs which were harmful
to the society. Consequently, Islamic legislation forbade interest because it takes
unfair advantage of the less fortunate members of society; fornication was
forbidden due to its exploitation of women and the destruction of family bonds;
and alcohol was prohibited because of the physical, psychological and spiritual
damage which it inflicts on both the individual and society as a whole. Trade
practices were reformed by making the basis of trade mutual consent, and by
disallowing all deceptive business transactions. The existing system of marriage
was organized by confirming certain forms and prohibiting others which were, in
fact, fornication or something close to it. The basis of divorce was also
recognized, but its pronouncements were limited.

(^20) Taareekh at-Tashree _‘_ al-Islaamee, pp.34-5.


Because Islaam did not come to destroy human civilization, morals and
customs, in order to build on it a new civilization with new morals and customs, it
looked at everything from the perspective of human welfare; what was harmful
was removed and what was beneficial was confirmed. Allaah says in the Qur’aan:

**ﹶثِئالﹾخبا علﹶيهِم ويحرم ِتَّ يباطال لﹶهم ُّويحِل ﹶرِكالﹾمن عن وينهاهم ِفبِالﹾمعرو يأﹾمرهم**

```
“ It commands them to do righteousness and prohibits them from
evil, and it makes allowable to them the good things and makes
forbidden to them all filth. ”^21
```
Islaam is fundamentally a system of building and not one of destruction as
its goal is reformation and not merely control and government. It should be noted,
however, that Islaam’s confirmation of some Arab customs does not mean that it
has taken its laws and principles from other sources, nor does it mean that those
practises which it confirmed are not a part of divine law. Whatever Islaam
confirmed is considered an integral part of the divine code for the following
reasons:

a) Some of the practises were inherited from earlier generations to whom
prophets had been sent. A good example of this is Hajj which was instituted by
Prophet Abraham and Ishmael.

b) Islamic principles do not contradict human reason nor are they
unintelligible. Instead, they free the human intellect from irrationality.
Consequently, the recognize the useful results of human intellectual activity.

c) If the confirmed practises were not present, Islaam would have
instituted them due to the existing human need for them.

Nevertheless, the number of confirmed practices were in fact, quite few in
proportion to the many which were cancelled. And, furthermore, even the little
that was confirmed was not kept in its existing form. Only its foundation
remained untouched.^22

(^21) Soorah al-A‘raaf (7) :157.
(^22) al-Madkhal, pp.57-9.


In order for Islamic legislation to achieve its goal of reformation, it has
enacted a series of legal commandments and prohibitions which make up the rules
of conduct governing the social system of Islaam. However, in the enactment of
laws, the Qur’anic revelations have taken into consideration the following four
basic principles:

1. The Removal of Difficulty.

The system of Islaam has been revealed for man’s benefit. It provides him
with guidance in all walks of life in order to ensure for him a righteous lifestyle
within a just society committed to the service of God. Islamic laws are not meant
to be a burden, creating difficulties for man in order for him to grow spiritually, as
some systems may claim. They are designed to facilitate mankind’s individual
and societal needs. As such, among the pillars on which Islaam is based is the
removal of unnecessary difficulties wherever possible. Evidence to support the
fact that Islamic law is based on the concept of removal of difficulty can be found
throughout the Qur’aan. The following verses from the Qur’aan are only a few
examples:

**وسعها إِلَّ ا نفﹾسا اللَّ ه ف ِّﹶلكي لﹶا**

```
“ Allaah does not burden a soul with more than it can bear. ”^23
```
**الﹾعسر ﹸمكبِ يرِيد ولﹶا الﹾيسر ﹸمكبِ اللَّ ه يرِيد**

```
“ Allaah wishes for you ease and He does not wish difficulty for
you. ”^24
```
**حرجٍ مِن الدينِ فِي ﹸمكعلﹶي جعلﹶ وما**

```
“ He did not make any difficulty for you in the religion. ”^25
```
**ضعِيفﹰا ِنسانﹸإالﹾ وخلِق ﹸمكعن ف ِّيخف أﹶنﹾ اللَّ ه يرِيد**

```
“ Allaah wishes to lighten the burden for you, for man was created
weak. ”^26
```
(^23) Soorah al-Baqarah (2):286.
(^24) Soorah al-Baqarah (2):185.
(^25) Soorah al-Hajj (22):78.
(^26) Soorah an-Nisaa (4):28.


Because of this principle, Allaah has enacted along with the divine laws a variety
of legal concessions, like the permission to break fast, and shorten and join
prayers during travel. Moreover, the consumption of prohibited substances (e.g.,
pork and alcohol) in cases of dire necessity was also permitted.

**رحِيم ﹶفﹸورغ اللَّ ه َِّنإفﹶ ِثﹾمٍإلِ ٍفمتجانِ ﹶيرغ مخمصةٍ فِي ﹸرطاض فﹶمن**

```
“ But if anyone is forced by hunger, with no inclination to
transgression, Allaah is indeed Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. ”^27
```
The Prophet (r), who was the prime example of how Islamic law was to be
implemented, was himself described as always choosing the easier path whenever
a choice was given to him between two possible paths, as long as the easier path
was not sinful.^28 He was also reported to have said to some of his followers on the
occasion of their dispatchment as governors of Yemen, _“_ Make things easy (for
the people) and do not make them difficult. _”_^29

Islamic legal scholars unanimously consider this concept an indisputable
fundamental principle followed by God in the enactment of laws. Consequently,
in their implementation of the divine laws, they have deduced many secondary
laws on this basis.^30

2. The Reduction of Religious Obligations.

A natural consequence of the previous principle is that the total number of
legal obligations should be relatively few. Accordingly, the prohibited acts and
substances in Islamic legislation are quite few in comparison to those which are
allowed by direct command or by the absence of any command or prohibition.
This principle can be clearly seen in the method by which the Qur’aan deals with
prohibitions and permissions. In the case of prohibitions, the sub-categories are
named and listed, while in the case of permissions, a general allowance is given
due to the great number of categories included in it. For example, with regard to
women with whom marriage is forbidden, Allaah states,

```
“ Prohibited to you are your mothers, your daughters, your sister
and your aunts... ”^31
```
After completing the prohibited categories, Allaah says,

```
“ Except for these, all others are lawful, provided you seek them in
marriage with a dowry and not for fornication. ”^32
```
As for foods, the forbidden categories are also listed in detail. The Qur’aan states,

**والﹾمنخنِقﹶةﹸ بِهِ اللَّ هِ يرِغلِ أﹸهِلَّ وما ِيرِترالﹾخِ ولﹶحم والدم الﹾميتةﹸ ﹸمكعلﹶي تحرم**

```
“ Forbidden to you (for food) are: animals which die of themselves,
blood, pork, animals slaughtered in the name of others besides
Allaah, animals killed by strangulation, or a blow, or a fall, or by
being gored... ”^33
```
On the other hand, in regard to the permissible foods, Allaah states,

**لﹶهم حِلٌّ ﹸمكﹶعامطو مﹸكلﹶ حِلٌّ بِتاكالﹾ أﹸوتوا الَّ ذِين ﹶعامطو تَّ يباطال ﹸمكلﹶ أﹸحِلَّ الﹾيوم**

```
“ On this day all good things are made lawful for you. The food of the
people of the Book is lawful to you and your food is lawful to
them... ”^34
```
Furthermore, in spite of the fact that the things which have been forbidden are
quiet few in comparison to those which have been permitted, the sun of one who

is forced to take forbidden substances has also been lifted, as was mentioned
previously. Allaah states this concession in a number of places in the Qur’aan. For
example:

```
“ But if anyone is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience,
nor transgressing due limits, there is no sin on him. For Allaah is
Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. ”^35
```
It is also worth noting that the laws, on the whole, do not contain so many details
as to create difficulty for those who wish to strictly follow the teachings of the
Qur’aan. Among the verses of the Qur’aan which indicate the existence of his
principle is the following:

**ينحِـ عنها تسأﹶلﹸوا وإِنﹾ كﹸمؤتس ﹸمكلﹶ تبد إِنﹾ أﹶشياءَ عن تسأﹶلﹸوا لﹶا منواآ الَّ ذِين هاياأﹶي**

```
“ Oh you who believe, do not ask about things which, if made plain
for you, will cause you trouble. But if you ask about them while the
Qur ’ aan is being revealed, they will be made plain to you. Allaah has
exempted them. And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Gentle. ”^36
```
The prohibited questions concern issues about which Allaah has chosen to enact
prohibitions due to their questions. And, if they did not ask about them, they
would have been left with a choice between doing them and not doing them.
Included in this category is the Prophet’s (r) response to a repeated question
concerning whether Hajj was compulsory every year.^37 He said, _“_ If I said yes, it
would have become compulsory. Leave me alone concerning things which I have
left up to you, for certainly those before you were destroyed because of their many
unnecessary questions and their arguments and disagreements with their

prophets. _”_^38 In another narration, he was reported to have said, _“_ If I have
prohibited you from doing something, avoid it totally. But if I command you to do
something, do as much of it as you can. _”_^39 He was also reported to have said,
_“_ The Muslims who have committed the gravest offense against Muslims are those
who asked about things which were not prohibited, but which became prohibited
because of their questions. _”_^40

A good example of limitation of details can be found in the Qur’anic
treatment of business transactions. The laws in this regard have not at all been
detailed. Instead, general precepts suitable for all circumstances have been
legislated. For example, Allaah states:

**بِالﹾعقﹸودِ أﹶوفﹸوا منواآ الَّ ذِين هاياأﹶي**

```
“ Oh you who believe, fulfil your contracts. ”^41

3. The Realization of Public Welfare

Because the laws of Islaam were primarily enacted for the general good of
all mankind, the Prophet (r) was a universal prophet sent to all people till the end
of time. Allaah stated that in the Qur’aan in no uncertain terms:

```
Naskh (Abrogation)

The existence of abrogation within Islamic legislation is among the
manifestations of human welfare considerations in Islamic legislation. God may
prescribe a law suitable to people at the time of its enactment, or it may serve a
particular limited purpose. However, its suitability may later disappear or its
unique purpose may have been achieved. In such circumstances, the need for the
law ceases to exist and its validity becomes cancelled. The following are only a
few of many such examples which may be found recorded in both the Qur’aan
and the Sunnah.^46

Bequest (Waseeyah): In pre-Islamic Arab culture, the property of the deceased
was inherited by his children, and parents would only inherit if a bequest were
made.^47 Thus, in the early stages of Islaam, Allaah made the writing of a bequest
for parents and relatives compulsory, in order to teach the new community of
Muslims the importance of family rights with regard to their wealth.

```
“ It is prescribed that when death approaches any of you, if he leaves
behind any goods, that he make a bequest to parents and next of kin,
according to what is reasonable. This is due from the pious. ”^48
```
(^44) Soorah Saba’ (34):28.
(^45) Soorah al-A‘raaf (7):158.
(^46) al-Madkhal, p.89-90.
(^47) See Sahih Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English), vol.4, p.6, no.10.
(^48) Soorah al-Baqarah (2):180.


However, after the community willingly accepted this law and they began to
strictly put it into practise, Allaah replaced it by revealing in the Qur’aan a clearly
defined system of inheritance laws. And the Prophet (r) further confirmed the
abrogation of the old laws by stating, _“_ Surely Allaah has given everyone with a
right (to inheritance) his right, so there should be no bequest for inheritors. _”_^49

Mourning Period: The widow’s mourning period was originally a full year, and
it was compulsory for her husband to leave in his will provision for maintenance
and housing during that whole period. The Qur’aan states:

**ﹶيرغ الﹾحولِ إِلﹶى متاعا واجِهِمزلِأﹶ وصِيةﹰ واجازأﹶ ويذﹶرونﹶ ﹸمكمِن يتوفَّ ونﹶ والَّ ذِين**

maintenance and residence should be made for their widows. But if
they leave the residence, there is no blame on you for what they do
with themselves, provided it is reasonable. And Allaah is exalted in
power, wise. ”^50
```
Then the waiting period was reduced to four months and ten days.

“ If any of you die and leave widows behind, they shall wait
concerning themselves four months and ten days. When they have
fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you if they dispose of
themselves in a just and reasonable manner. And Allaah is well
acquainted with all that you do. ”^51
```
(^49) Reported by Abu Umaamah and collected by Abu Daawood (Sunan Abu Dawud (English
Trans.), vol.2, p.808, no.2864), at-Tirmidhee, an-Nasaa’ee, Ibn Maajah and Ahmad, and
authenticated (Saheeh) by al-Albaanee in Saheeh Sunan Abee Daawood, vol.2, p.218, no.1721.
(^50) Soorah al-Baqarah (2):240.
(^51) Soorah al-Baqarah (2):234.


And the bequest was cancelled by the verses on inheritance which
stipulated a specific portion for widows: one quarter of all the inheritance if she
did not have any children, and one eight if she had children.

Fornication: Originally, the punishment for the crime of fornication and adultery,
as well as other sex crimes like homosexuality, was the confinement and
punishment of offenders in their homes until they became repentant and sought to
reform themselves.

punish them both; but if they repent and make amends, leave them
alone. For Allaah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful. ”^52
```
This law was later abrogated in the Qur’aan by the setting of particular exemplary
punishment.

“ Flog the woman and man guilty of fornication one hundred lashes.
And, if you believe in Allaah and the Last Day, do not let compassion

group of the believers witness the punishment. ”^53
```
(^52) Soorah an-Nisaa (4):15-6.
(^53) Soorah an-Noor (24):2.


Furthermore, the Prophet (r) applied the punishment of stoning to death
for those who committed adultery^54 and set the death penalty for homosexuals
without specifying the method.^55

A review of the abrogated verses indicates that the early law may be
replaced by a more severe law, as in the case of the law for fornication which
changed from confinement and punishment to lashes or stoning to death; or it may
be replaced by a less severe law as in the case of mourning period for widows; or
it may be replaced by a similar but more suitable law. At any rate, in all cases, the
abrogated law was suitable for the time and circumstances under which it was
revealed. When the situation changed, a new law was enacted in order to realize
Allaah’s intent in the earlier legislation. Were it not for the situation of the
Muslim community earlier, the abrogating law would have been enacted from the
beginning. For example, in the case of the widow who was at first required to wait
in her deceased husband’s house in mourning for the period of one year during
which she could not get married, it was the custom of the Arabs to confine
widows and prevent them from marriage for indefinite periods, lasting from a
year to the remainder of their lives. And, during the period of confinement, they
were obliged to wear their worst clothes.^56 If the waiting period were reduced to
four months and ten days along with the permission for them to leave their houses
if they wished, the early Muslims would have had great difficulty in accepting it.
Consequently, a year of mourning was set along with the cancellation of the
confinement and the obligation of maintenance. Shortly after they had accepted
the change and adjusted to it, the new law was revealed reducing the period of
mourning.

Thus, abrogation contained in it consideration for human conditions and
their welfare the era of the prophethood which ended with the death of the
Prophet (r), for there can be no abrogation after his time.^57

Legislative consideration of human welfare after the era of prophethood
can be found in the fact that Islamic laws were enacted for reasons, many of
which clearly mentioned.

The following verses or portions of verses from the Qur’aan are among the
many cases where the purposes for the enactment of laws were explained:

“ Satan ’ s plan is to incite enmity and hatred between you, with
intoxicants and gambling, and prevent you from the remembrance of

```
The Prophet (r) often made mention of the rationale behind his legal
pronouncements. For example, in the case of the abrogation of the prohibition of
visiting graveyards, he was reported to have said, _“_ I had forbidden you from
visiting the graveyards, however, permission has been given to me to visit the
grave of my mother, So, visit them, for they do remind one of the next life. _”_^61

The explanation of the reasons for laws indicates that the presence or
absence of laws depends on the existence or non-existence of their causes. If the
benefit for which the law was enacted is continuous, then the law is continuous;
but if it has changed due to a change in circumstances, the law must also change;
otherwise there would not be any benefit in its continued existence. On the basis

Trans.), vol.2, pp.463-4, no.2130-1) and at-Tirmidhee.


of this principle, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab cancelled the distribution of the portion
of Zakaah assigned for the encouragement of non-Muslims to accept Islaam
which the Prophet (r) used to give out. As he explained, the need for their
encouragement existed during the time when Islaam was on the rise and in need
of support, however, in his time the Islamic state was already firmly established.

Legislative consideration of human needs can also be found in the
methodology of legislation. In the case of laws wherein human benefit will not
change with time or conditions, Allaah has spelled out the details very clearly. For
example, in the case of religious rites, family laws of marriage, divorce and
inheritance, laws against crimes whose harm will not change with the passage of
time, like murder, fornication and adultery, theft, and slander. As for things whose
benefit or harm may vary from place to place, Allaah has legislated general laws
of universal benefit which may be implemented by those in authority according to
human needs. Examples of this category can be found in the laws concerning
business transactions and the structuring of the society. For example, Allaah said,

#### ﹸمكمِن الﹾأﹶمرِ وأﹸولِي الرسولﹶ ِيعواطوأﹶ اللَّ ه ِيعواطأﹶ منواآ الَّ ذِين هاياأﹶي

```
“ Oh you who believe, obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, and
those in authority among you. ”^62
```
The Prophet (r) himself was reported to have said, _“_ If a maimed Abyssinian slave
is appointed over you and he conducts your affairs according to the Book of
Allaah, you should listen to him and obey (his orders). _”_^63

Legislative consideration can also be found in the giving of precedence to
the general welfare over individual benefit, and to the prevention of a greater
harm over a smaller one.^64 A good example of such a principle can be found in
Islaam’s confirmation of the almost universal practise of plural marriage
(polygyny). Islaam limited the maximum number of wives to four and outlined
the responsibilities of those involved. Although sharing a husband may be painful
to most women, the need for plural marriage in most societies evidenced by the
corruption which results from its official prohibition demand its legislation.
Therefore, for the general welfare of both men and women, Islaam recognized
limited polygyny thereby giving precedence to the good of society over that of the
individual woman.^65

4. The Realization of Universal Justice.

Islamic legislation considers all humans the same with regards to their
obligation to submit to the divine laws and in their responsibility for breaking
them. The laws mentioned in the Qur’aan are all general, making no distinction
between one group or another.

```
During the era of the prophethood, a woman from the powerful tribe of
makhzoom stole some jewelry and confessed to the crime when the case was
brought before the Prophet (r). Her tribesmen wanted to avoid the shame of
having the Qur’aanic punishment applied to her, so they asked Usaamah ibn Zayd
who was close to the Prophet (r) to intercede on her behalf. When Usaamah
approached the Prophet (r), he became very angry with him and said, _“_ Do you
dare to intercede in one Allaah _’_ s fixed punishment? _”_ He then called the people
together and delivered a sermon in which he said, _“_ The people before you were

destroyed because they let the nobles go when they stole, but applied Allaah _’_ s
fixed punishment on the weak when they stole. By Allaah, if my own daughter,
Faatimah, stole I would cut off her hand. _”_^69 ”^70

Examples of Laws Derived from the Qur’aan

(a) Inheritance

If a person dies and leaves behind wealth for his children, it must be divided
up amongst his heirs according to some system of rules. The Qur’aan provides
certain basic laws for the division of inheritance among the relatives of the
deceased. Allaah says:

**فﹶلﹶهن اثﹾنتينِ قفﹶو ًساءنِ كﹸن ِنﹾإفﹶ الﹾأﹸنثﹶيينِ ِّظح مِثﹾلﹸ لِلذَّ كﹶرِ أﹶولﹶادِكﹸم فِي اللَّ ه ﹸمكيوصِي**

“ Allaah advises you concerning your children ’ s (inheritance): the
male should get a portion equal to that of two females. If there are
only daughters, two or more should receive two-thirds of the
inheritance and if only one her share is a half. ”^71
```
(b) Theft

Similarly, if a person is caught stealing, the punishment for such a crime is
mentioned in the Qur’aan. Allaah said:

**عزِيز واللَّ ه اللَّ هِ مِن ﹶالﹰاكن كﹶسبا بِما ًجزاء أﹶيدِيهما اﹶعوطفﹶاقﹾ والسارِقﹶةﹸ قوالسارِ**

4.2 THE SUNNAH
```
The Sunnah represents the record of the true sayings, actions and approvals of the
Prophet (r) which were related by his Sahaabah (companions) to the next
generation of Muslims and collected in books by those scholars who came after
them. After the Prophet (r) passed away, the companions were left to run the
Islamic state based on the principles found in the Qur’aan and whatever else the
Prophet (r) had taught them. If a problem arose which could not be solved by
using the Qur’aan alone, the Khaleefah^1 would ask among the companions if
anyone had heard the Prophet (r) way anything concerning it. Usually someone
would get up and say I heard the Prophet (r) say so and so, or I saw him do this
or that. In this way the sayings and actions of the Prophet (r) became common
knowledge to many. As the borders of the Islamic state expanded and large
numbers of people accepted Islaam, many would travel miles to come and study
under the Sahaabah in order to learn Islaam. The Sahaabah would tell them what
they heard the Prophet (r) say, or show them what they saw the Prophet (r) do.

In this way the sayings and actions of the Prophet (r) were handed down to the
next generation of Muslims referred to as the Taabi _‘_ oon. It was during the era of
the Taabi _‘_ oon that Hadeeths began to be recorded in writing on a fairly large
scale, but it was really in the following generation known as the Atbaa _‘_ at-
Taabi _‘_ een and the generation following them that Hadeeth were organized
according to subject matter and put in one of the six major books of Hadeeths
called the Sihaah as-Sittah.^2

Sometimes the Prophet (r) would explain the intent of the Qur’anic texts
by making a statement, at other times he would do so by an act, and yet other
times he would do so by both. for example, the Qur’aan commanded the believers
to establish regular Salaah (formal prayer) without describing how Salaah should
be performed, so the Prophet (r) prayed among his followers then told them,
_“_ Pray as you have seen me pray. _”_^6 On another occasion, while he was praying a
man came and greeted him, so he raised his right hand in response.^7 His wife
‘Aa’eshah reported that when he made Sujood (prostration) in Salaah, he would
keep his heels together.^8 On yet another occasion, he passed by Ibn Mas‘oud
praying with his left hand on his right, so he removed it and placed his right hand
on his left.^9 He was also reported to have said, _“_ If any of you makes Sujood, he

Thus, the Sunnah was an exposition of the Qur’aan by which its
generalities were clarified and its intended meanings specified. Consequently,
everything in the Sunnah is addressed in the Qur’aan, either by inference or by
direct reference. The address may be so general as to include the whole Sunnah as
in the case of the verse:

**فﹶانتهوا عنه نهاكﹸم وما فﹶخذﹸوه الرسولﹸ آتاكﹸم وما**

“ Whatever the messenger gives you, take it; and whatever he forbids
you, leave it. ”^11
```
Or the address may indicate generally defined laws, the details of which are left to
the Sunnah. Hence, the Sunnah may explain the methodology, reasons,
requirements and location, or it may explain the inclusions which could not be
logically deduced. An example of such inclusions may be found in the case of
forbidden foods beyond those mentioned in the Qur’aan. Allaah does state in
reference to the Prophet (r):

**الﹾخبائِثﹶ علﹶيهِم ويحرم الطَّ يباتِ لﹶهم ويحِلُّ**

“ He made lawful for them the good (and pure) things and forbade
them the bad (and impure). ”^12
```
Anas ibn Maalik said, _‘_ On the day of the Battle of Khaybar, a visitor came and
said, _‘_ Oh messenger of Allaah, the donkeys have been eaten. _’_ Then another came
and said, _‘_ Oh messenger of Allaah, the donkeys are being destroyed. _’_ Allaah _’_ s
Messenger ( _r_ ) then sent Abu Talhah to make an announcement: Allaah and His
Messenger have prohibited you from eating the flesh of domesticated donkeys, for
it is bad (and impure). _”_^13

Or the address may indicate general principles from which the Prophet (r)
may deduce rulings. Such rulings may be confirmed by Allaah if correct, or
corrected by Allaah if incorrect. Among what appears to be confirmed deduced
rulings is the case of marriage to a woman and her maternal or paternal aunt. The
Qur’aan forbids marrying a woman and her daughter or the simultaneous
marriage of two sisters, then says,

```
“ Except for these, all others are lawful... ”^14
```
However, Abu Hurayrah reported that Allaah’s Messenger (r) said, _“_ One should
not combine a woman and her father _’_ s sister in marriage, or a woman and her
mother _’_ s sister. _”_^15 This ruling may have been deduced because the reason for
prohibiting the combination of a woman and her daughter or two sisters, is present
in the combination of a woman and her aunt. For, among the narrations of this
statement of the Prophet (r) is the explanatory addition, _“_ If you do that, you will
break family ties. _”_ That is, in the same way that the sanctity of the relationship
between sisters, or a mother and her daughter, would be destroyed by the spirit of
rivalry found between co-wives, it would also be destroyed between a woman and
her aunt.

Among the examples of deduced rulings which were not confirmed is that
of the Dhihaar divorce. Khawlah bint Tha‘labah said, _“_ My husband, Aws ibn as-
Saamit, pronounced the words: You are to me like my mother _’_ s back. So I came to
Allaah _’_ s messenger to complain against my husband. However, the messenger of
Allaah disagreed with me and said, _‘_ Fear Allaah, He is your cousin. _’_ I continued
complaining until the verse was revealed:

The Prophet (r) had accepted DHihaar as being a valid form of divorce and had
told Khawlah to accept it, however Allaah declared it invalid.

There also exists another category of unconfirmed deduced rulings which
demonstrate that the Sunnah is limited to confirmed religious rulings and exclude
personal habits and customs of the Prophet (r) which he did not instruct his
followers to follow. Raafi‘ ibn Khadeej reported that Allaah’s Messenger (r)
came to Madeenah and found the people grafting their date-palm trees. He asked
them what they were doing and they informed him that they were artificially
pollinating the trees. He then said, _“_ Perhaps it would be better if you did not do
that, _”_ When they abandoned the practise, the yield of the date-palms became less.
So they informed him and he said, _“_ I am a human being. So when I tell you to do
something pertaining to the religion, accept it, but when I tell you something from
my personal opinion, keep in mind that I am a human being. _”_ Anas reported that
he added, _“_ You have better knowledge (of technical skills) in the affairs of this
world. _”_^18

The Prophet (r) further informed his followers that even in the case of
legal judgements with regard to disputes brought before him, he could
unintentionally rule incorrectly, as some of such decisions were based on his own
opinion. Umm Salamah reported that Allaah’s Messenger (r) said, _“_ I am only a
human being, and you bring your disputes to me. Perhaps some of you are more
eloquent in their plea than others, and I judge in their favor according to what I
hear from them. So, whatever I rule in anyone _’_ s favor which belongs to his
brother, he should not take any of it, because I have only granted him a piece of
Hell. _”_^19 Such decisions based on personal reasoning represented training for the
companions of the Prophet (r) in the methodology of application of the
Sharee‘ah. It taught them that a judge is not held responsible if he makes a
mistake in judgement due to factors beyond his control. And, in order to further
emphasize this important point, the Prophet (r) also said, _“_ Whoever makes a
reasoned decision (Ijtihaad) and is correct will receive two rewards, while he
who does so and is incorrect will receive one reward. _”_^20 However, such decisions
have to be based on knowledge, for the Messenger of Allaah (r) also said, _“_ There
are three types of judges; one who will go to paradise and two who will go to

Hell. The one in paradise is the man who knows the truth and judges according to
it. The man who knows the truth and is unjust in his judgement will be in Hell.
And the man without knowledge who makes judgement for people will also go to
Hell. _”_^21 The Prophet (r) also encouraged his companions to make legal rulings
in order to prepare them to carry on the application of the Sharee _‘_ ah after he left
them.

‘Alee ibn Abee Taalib said, “Allaah _’_ s Messenger ( _r_ ) sent me to Yemen as
a judge, so I asked, _‘_ Oh messenger of Allaah! You are sending me and I am
young, and I have no knowledge of giving judgement? _’_ He replied, _‘_ Allaah will
guide your heart and keep your tongue firmly (attached to the truth). When two
litigants sit before you, do not decide until you have heard what the other has to
say the way you heard the first, for it is more suitable for the correct judgement to
become clear to you. _’”_^22

Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudree was reported to have said, _“_ The QuraydHah tribe
surrendered on the condition that it would be Sa _‘_ d ibn Mu _‘_ aadh who would pass
judgement on them, so the Messenger of Allaah ( _r_ ) sent for him. When Sa _‘_ d
approached the Masjid riding on a donkey, Allaah _’_ s Messenger ( _r_ ) said to the
Ansaar (Muslims of Madeenah), _‘_ Stand up to receive you chief. _’_ And he said to
Sa _‘_ d, _‘_ These people have surrendered accepting your decision. _’_ Sa _‘_ d said,
_‘_ Execute their warriors and take their women and children as prisoners. On
hearing that the Prophet ( _r_ ) said, _‘_ You have judged according to Allaah _’_ s
judgement. _’”_^23

The process of arriving at reasoned decisions to suit new circumstances
and the decisions themselves are referred to as Ijtihaad. As has been seen, both
the Prophet (r) and his companions practised Ijtihaad during this stage in the
development of Islamic law. However, it should be noted that the Ijtihaads of the
Prophet (r) which occurred during this period are not considered an independant
source of law, because their validity depended on divine revelation for
confirmation. Thus, the Ijtihaads of the Prophet (r) were essentially a means of
giving the companions lessons in the methods of Ijtihaad, and the Ijtihaads of the
Sahaabah, at this early stage, were basically for practice.”^24

Examples of Laws Derived from the Sunnah

(a) Inheritance

The division of inheritance for close family members is clearly explained in
the Qur’aan. But, the leaving of wealth for non-Muslim relatives is not mentioned
in the Qur’aan. In the Sunnah we find that the Prophet (r) said, _“_ A Muslim may
not inherit from a non-Muslim, nor may a non-Muslim inherit from a Muslim. _”_^25

(b) Theft

The minimum amount for which a thief’s hand may be cut off and how much
of the hand is to be cut off can only be found in the Sunnah. ‘Aa’ishah reported
that Allaah’s Messenger (r) said, _“_ The hand of a thief can only be cut off for (the
value of) a quarter of a dinar and upwards. _”_^26

4.3 IJMAA‘ AND QIYAAS

IJMAA‘

Ijmaa _‘_ is the joint agreement of the Sahaabah on a point of Islamic law not found
in either the Qur’aan or the Sunnah, but based on one of them (not disagreeing
with what is in them). When certain problems arose after the death of the Prophet
(r), the Sahabah used to gather together to try and solve them. They would go
over the Qur’aan to see if Allaah had something specific to say on the subject, and
if they found nothing, the Khaleefah (Muslim leader) would ask if anyone had

heard the Prophet (r) say anything concerning it. If they still did not find the
answer, the Khaleefah would then give his opinion based on the Qur’aan and or
Sunnah and so would others, if they thought that their ideas were better. The
various opinions would then be discussed until they agreed on the best one and
then they would make it into a law for all the Muslims.

In this way the laws of Islaam could be molded to fit all times and all
circumstances. The new laws which were made by Ijmaa _‘_ were not basic laws, as
all the basic laws had already been set down by Allaah in the Qur’aan and by the
Prophet (r) in his Sunnah. These laws were secondary laws which could vary
according to various situations.

The Difference between Ijmaa‘ and Secular Democracy

Although Ijmaa _‘_ looks similar to the democratic process, whereby opinions
are expressed and the opinion favored by the majority becomes law, there is a
fundamental difference. In the case of Western Secular Democracy, its roots in
revelation are cut off. Secularism requires that religion should not have any role to
play in the legal system. Humanism replaces religion. Whatever humans find
most appropriate, logical, reasonable, etc., becomes good and whatever is not is
bad. Since human opinions are strongly influenced by environment, the resultant
laws are often unjust. Furthermore, the laws decided upon can be primary laws
and they can supplant existing primary laws. On the other hand, Ijmaa _‘_ laws are
religiously based and they are not primary laws but secondary laws. Also, they
cannot replace already established primary laws.

Examples of Laws Derived by Ijmaa‘


(a) Collection of the Qur **’** aan

```
The Qur’aan was revealed to the Prophet (r) in sections over a period of 23
```
years. Whenever a verse was revealed the Prophet (r) had some of his
companions write it down on whatever was available, and many memorized it
when the Prophet (r) recited it in Salaah. The Prophet (r) did not have the
written sections of the Qur’aan gathered together in one book during his life time.
After the Prophet’s death, the various sections of the Qur’aan, which were written
down on tree barks, animal skins and bones, remained in the possession of the
Sahaabah. Most of them had also memorized large portions of the Qur’aan during
the Prophet’s (r) lifetime, but there were only a few ho had memorized the whole
Qur’aan.

During the reign of the first Caliph Abu Bakr, the Sahaabah decided by
Ijmaa _‘_ that they should gather all the pieces of the Qur’aan together into one
complete book. The job was given to Zayd ibn Thaabit since he was one of the
Prophet’s (r) scribes and he had memorized all of it and had recited it back to the
Prophet (r) a number of times. Zayd gathered all that had been written and
compared it with what he and others had mamorized, then wrote it down in one
book, which he turned over to the Caliph.

(b) The Adhaans of Jummu **‘** ah

During the time of the Prophet (r) there was only one Adhaan for the
Salaah of Jumu _‘_ ah (Friday congregational prayer) and it was made when the
Prophet (r) entered the Masjid (Mosque) and said, _“_ Salaam _‘_ alaykum. _”_ During
the reign of the first and second Caliphs the Adhaan remained as it was, but
during the reign of the third Caliph, ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan, another Adhaan was
added. The city of Madeenah had become large and so had its market place, so
much so, that the Adhaan of Jumu _‘_ ah was drowned out by the noise of the traders
and their customers. Realizing this, Caliph ‘Uthmaan suggested to the other
Sahaabah that another Adhaan be called before the main Adhaan, and that it be
done in the middle of the market. They all agreed by Ijmaa _‘_ , and thus another
Adhaan was added.

QIYAAS

Qiyaas is the deduction of Islaamic Laws not found in the Qur’aan, the
Sunnah or Ijmaa _‘_ , but based on laws found in one of them. If a problem arises
which none of the first three sources addressed directly, we then try to find a law
in any one of them which had a similar cause, and classify the problem in a


similar manner. Qiyaas based on resemblance (qiyaas ash-shabah) is not
acceptable as the similarity may have no relationship to the ruling attached to it.
For example, it may be argued that wine is similar to grape juice: both are made
from grapes, they have a similar color and taste. However, the ruling on wine is
not due to these factors but its intoxicating effect. Qiyaas is the basis by which
suggestions for Ijmaa were made.

Examples of Laws Derived by Qiyaas

(a) Drugs

For example, drugs like marijuana and cocaine (crack) were not around in
the Prophet’s (r) time nor in the time of the Sahaabah, so nothing direct was said
concerning them However, the Prophet (r) had said: _“_ Every intoxicant is
Khamr,^1 so every intoxicant is Haraam. _”_^2 When we observe those who smoke or
inject marijuana, cocaine and similar drugs, we notice that they lose some if not
all of their senses, they become high (intoxicated). Therefore, we can conclude
that marijuana and coke are forms of Khamr, and therefore they are Haraam. As
for those who say that they only take a little bit and it does not make them
intoxicated, the Prophet (r) also said, _“_ Whatever intoxicates in large amounts is
Haraam in small amounts. _”_^3 It should be noted that minute amounts of in
medicines or other foods or drinks do not make them haraam. If large amounts of
these medicines or foods and drinks are consumed and they do not intoxicate, they
are halaal for use. Prophet Muhammad (r) permitted the consumption of nabeeth
(fermented drinks) as long as they did not become intoxicating.^4 That is, they
were permissible until the alcohol content became high enough to intoxicate.
However, it is not permissible for Muslims to make medicines and put alcohol in
them because it would require that they either produce or purchase alcohol both of
which are not permissible. Vinegar is prepared by fermenting substances which
become alcohol and eventually transform into vinegar. Minute quantities of
alcohol will always remain in the process. These minute quantities are of no
consequence as they do not render the vinegar intoxicating.

(^1) Khamr is literally an alcoholic drink made from fermented grape juice.

(b) Smoking

When cigarettes and tobacco first reached the Ottoman Muslim empire in
the 17th century most scholars ruled by Qiyaas that it was Makrooh (disliked),
because the only known ill effects at that time was “smoker’s breath”, which was
offensive. This ruling was based on an authentic Hadeeth in which the Prophet

(r) had said, _“_ Whoever eats any of this offensive plant (garlic) should not come
to the mosque. _”_ The people said, _“_ It has been forbidden! It has been forbidden! _”_
When this reached the Prophet (r), he said, _“_ O people, I can not forbid what
Allaah has made lawful, but it is a plant whose odour I dislike. _”_^5 On another
occasion he included onions and leek as also offensive.^6 However, in our times
the medical profession has now stated that smoking causes cancer alongwith a
number of other illnesses. Since, in most cases cancer causes death, it can now be
said that smoking kills. So, a number of scholars now rule by Qiyaas that smoking
is Haraam, because one who does so is, in fact, committing suicide and Allaah
has said:

**رحِيما بِكﹸم كﹶانﹶ اللَّ ه إِنَّ أﹶنفﹸسكﹸم تقﹾتلﹸوا ولﹶا**

```
“ And do not kill yourselves, for Allaah is indeed merciful to
you. ”^7
```
**التهلﹸكﹶةِ إِلﹶى بِأﹶيدِيكﹸم تلﹾقﹸوا ولﹶا**

```
“ ...and do not throw yourselves into destruction with your own
hands. ”^8
```
The Prophet (r) also said: _“_ Whoever kills himself with a knife will be in Hell
forever stabbing himself in his stomach. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself
will drink it eternally in the Hell fire. And whoever kills himself by falling off a
mountain will forever fall in the fire of Hell. _”_^9

(^5) Reported by Abu Sa‘eed and collected by Muslim (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), vol.1, p.280,
no.1149).
(^6) Reported by Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillaah and collected by Muslim (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.),
vol.1, p.280, no.1147).
(^7) Soorah an-Nisaa’, (4):195.
(^8) Soorah al-Baqarah, (2):195..
(^9) Reported by Abu Hurayrah and collected by Muslim (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), vol.1, p.62,
no.199).


According to Islamic law, it makes no difference whether someone kills
himself by taking small amounts of poison over a long period of time or a large
enough amount all at once, It is Haraam to take any substance which is known to
be harmful.

Significance

By using the principle of Qiyaas the basic laws of Islaam can be applied at
anytime and in any place. New rulings can be made for any new circumstances,
based on their similarities with the basic laws of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah. In
this way, the divine laws revealed in the Qur’aan and Sunnah remain unchanged
without becoming outdated. It can not be successfully argued that Islamic law can
not be applied in the 20th century because it is 1,400 years old. The fundamental
laws of Islaam were made by God who created man and knows what is best for
him under all circumstances. There are certain basic characteristics of man which
do not change with time or location. It is these areas which the basic laws of
Islaam address. As for the changing aspects of human life, the Qur’aan and
Sunnah provide basic principles which may be applied by Qiyaas whenever the
need arises. Thus, Islamic law is suitable for mankind in all eras wherever he may
be, whether on earth or on the planets or on a distant star.


```
4.4 LEGAL CATEGORIES
```
According to Islaamic Law, all acts and things may be divided into two main
categories: those that are permissible, known as Halaal, and those that are
forbidden, known as Haraam. There is nothing in existence which does not fall
under one of these two categories.

QUR **’** AAN SUNNAH^

HARAAM HALAAL^

```
MAKROOH MUBAAH MUSTAHABB WAAJIB
```
HALAAL (PERMISSIBLE)

The category of Halaal is further divided into four sub-Divisions based on the
way in which they were made allowable:

1. Waajib of Fard (Obligatory)

The act which is considered Waajib must be done. If one does it he is rewarded
by Allaah, and if he fails to do it (purposely) he has committed a sin and will be
punished. How do we know if something is Waajib? If Allaah or His Prophet

(r) has said it is Waajib? If Allaah or His Prophet (r) has ordered us to do
something without making any exceptions, it is considered Waajib. The proof of
this is in Allaah’s statement in the Qur’aan.


```
“ Whatever the Prophet orders you, do it, and whatever he forbids
you, leave it! ” Soorah al-Hashr (59): 7
```
The Qur’aan orders us to worship Allaah without partners, establish regular
Salaah and pay our Zakaah in Soorah al-Bayyinah (97), verse 5:

```
“ And they were only ordered to worship Allaah, alone, establish
their Salaah and pay their Zakaah. ”
```
That is the real religion. Therefore, it is Waajib that we worship only Allaah, pray
out five daily Salaah and give our yearly Zakaah to the poor. If we do we will be
greatly rewarded by Allaah, but if we worship someone or something other than
Allaah, leave our Salaah or refuse to pay our Zakaah, we will be punished.

The Prophet (r) commanded us saying, “Pray all of you just as you saw me
pray. _”_^1 Therefore, it is Waajib on all Muslims to pray in some way that the last

Prophet (r) prayed. If we do so, we will get the full reward of Salaah, but if we
know the right way and pray another way, we will be punished by Allaah and our
Salaah will not be accepted.

The purpose behind the category of waajib acts is:

i)

ii)

iii)

```
to identify for humans the absolutely essential acts which they must do
in order to help them succeed in both this life and the next.
```
```
to train the believer in submission to God, which is the foundation of
righteousness.
```
```
to provide a basic framework of righteous deeds for the believer’s life.
```

2. Mustahabb (Recommended)

The act which is Mustahabb is one which the Prophet (r) has encouraged
us to do. If someone does it, Allaah will reward him, but if he doesn’t do it, he has
not done a sin and will not be punished. The Mustahabb things are there to help
us get used to obeying Allaah and His Prophet (r) so that when we are given
something Waajib to do, it will be easier for us to do it. It is also a means by
which one can make up for the mistakes made in Fard acts.

How do we know when something is Mustahabb? Acts classified as
Mustahabb are those which

(a) the Prophet ( **r** ) used to do regularly. For example, the Prophet (r) used to
pray two Raka‘aat^2 of voluntary prayer before doing the Fard Salaah of Fajr,
even when he was travelling and stopped doing other prayers before and after
the other compulsory prayers.^3 Thus, it is considered Mustahabb for us to pray
these two Raka _‘_ aat whenever possible

(b) those he recommended. For example, the Prophet (r) encouraged Muslims
to fast on certain days in the year outside the month of Ramadaan. He was
reported to have said that one who fasted six days in the month of Shawwaal 4
along with the whole month of Ramadaan, would get the reward for fasting
the whole year.^5 Similarly, he also recommended ‘Umrah in Ramadaan by
saying that one who does so would be rewarded like one who made Hajj with
him.^6

(c) those which he ordered done and then later allowed not to be done. An
example of the third type of Mustahabb acts is the command for Ghusl
(Islamic bath) on Friday. Initially the Prophet (r) said that “Ghusl on Friday
is compulsory on everyone reaching puberty. _”_^7 but he later said, _“_ Whoever
makes Wudoo **_’_** on Friday is blessed, but making the Ghusl is better. _”_^8

(d) those which he prohibited and then later commanded. And an example of
the fourth kind can be found in the command to visit graves. Regarding this,
the Prophet (r) said, “I used to prohibit you from visiting the graves, (but
now) visit them, as it will remind (of the next life). _”_^9

The purpose behind the category of mustahabb acts is:

i)

ii)

iii)

iv)

```
to identify certain beneficial acts which humans may not necessarily
realize.
```
```
to train humans in obeying God. Each compulsory acts as an equivalent
recommended version.
```
```
to protect the area of compulsory acts with a shield of other good acts. If
a believer becomes weak and neglects acts, it would be from the
mustahabb and not the waajib.
```
```
to provide a body of good deeds which can make up for deficiencies in
the compulsory acts.
```
3.Mubaah (Allowed)

The act which is considered Mubaah is one which hasn’t been ordered,
recommended, disliked or forbidden by Allaah and His Prophet (r).^10 It is
something optional, meaning that we may or may not do it. If we do it without
any particular intention, there is no reward from Allaah, and if we do not, there is
no punishment. Examples of things that are Mubaah are taking a bath on a hot
day to cool off, buying a Pepsi instead of a Mirinda, or scratching your head with
your left hand or right hand.

Khaalid ibn al-Waleed related that he went with Allaah _’_ s Messenger (r) to
visit Khaalid _’_ s aunt Maymoonah, who was one of the Prophet _’_ s wives, and found

Buraydah, and authenticated by al-Albaanee in Saheeh al-Jaami _‘_ as-Sagheer, vol.4, p.187,
no.4460 from Anas in al-Mustadrak.
10 i.e. by Allaah and His Prophet.


that she had roasted a Dabb (a large desert lizard). When she offered the lizard
(dish) to Allaah _’_ s Messenger (r), he refused it, so Khaalid asked him if lizards
were prohibited. He replied, _“_ No, but there were none in my people _’_ s land and I
find that I dislike in my people _’_ s land and I find that I dislike them. _”_ Khaalid
said, _“_ I then bit off a piece, chewed and ate it with the Prophet (r) looking at
me. _”_^11 Eating Dabb is therefore Mubaah. The Prophet (r) disliked it personally,
but permitted it for others.

It should be noted that this category could become a source of reward if
done with a good intention. For example, choosing the best foods to eat for the
purpose of looking after one’s body, a gift from God, would be a commendable
act.

The purpose behind the category of mubaah acts is:

i)
to increase the area of Halaal acts and giving humans more freedom of
choice so that they have no reason for going to the haraam.

4. Makrooh (Disliked)

The act which is considered Makrooh is the one which

1. Allaah or His Prophet ( **r** ) has described as being nasty or disgusting. For
    example, the Prophet (r) said, “The one who plays backgammon is like one
    who dyes his hand in the blood of swine. _”_^12 Since dyeing one’s hand in pig’s
    blood is a nasty act, so is playing backgammon, so we should avoid it and
    games that are similar to it.
2. the Prophet ( **r** ) forbade but later did to let us know that it is not a sin
    and that it was only disliked. An example of the second category can be
    found in the Prophet’s prohibition of drinking while standing. Abu Hurayrah
    quoted Allaah’s Messenger (r) as saying, _“_ None of you should drink while

12 Collected by Muslim (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.) vol.4, p.1222, no.5612) and Abu
Daawood ( Sunan Abu Dawud (English Trans.), vol.3, p.1374, no.4920).


```
standing ; And if anyone forgets, he should vomit. ”^13 However, the Prophet
(r) was also known to have drank while standing. ‘Alee ibn Abee Taalib
prayed the noon prayer and then sat down in the wide courtyard (of the
Masjid) of Kufah in order to deal with the affairs of the people until ‘Asr
prayer. Water was then brought to him. He drank some of it, made Wudoo ’ ,
then stood up and drank the remaining water while standing and said, “Some
people dislike to drink water while standing, but the Prophet (r) did as I have
just done.”^14
```
The makrooh acts represent category of actions which contains some form of
harm in them. The harm may be physical or spiritual, however, the effects are not
serious enough to have the acts strictly prohibited. For example, the father of
Ya‘eesh ibn Tikhafah said, “While I was lying on my stomach in the early
morning, a man began to nudge me with his foot and then said, _‘_ This is a method
of lying which God hates. _’_ When I looked up I saw that it was Allaah _’_ s
Messenger. _”_^15 After extensive research into spinal ailments and their causes,
specialists from the medical profession made the following recommendations:
“Poor sleep posture is a sure invitation to backaches. Use a firm mattress. Lie on
the side with a bend to the knees. Avoid lying on the belly, a position that
increases the lumber curve, causing that familiar sagging called swayback.”^16
Thus, the avoidance of sleeping on the stomach does protect man from some
physical harm. There may also be other physical harm as well as spiritual harm
unknown to us.

We are encouraged to avoid the makrooh acts since they are close to being
forbidden. If we avoid them, Allaah will reward us, but if we do them, there is no
punishment. If someone gets into the habit of doing makrooh things it will be easy
for him to fall into the forbidden things. So, we should avoid them as much as
possible.

For example, one who follows the Prophet’s (r) advice regarding
backgammon is rewarded by Allaah, while one who insists on playing it, we will
likely end up playing it for money and fall into the sin of gambling, which is
strictly forbidden and punishable in this life and the next.

The purpose behind the category of makrooh acts is:

i)

ii)

iii)

```
to protect human beings from some harmful acts.
```
```
that avoiding Makrooh acts trains man in self-control to make the
avoidance of Haraam acts easier.
```
```
to place a barrier between the believer and the haraam acts so that in
times of weakness, a person would only fall into the disliked rather than
the forbidden.
```
HARAAM (FORBIDDEN)

An act is considered Haraam if Allaah or His Messenger (r) ordered us not
to do it, without making any exceptions. If we avoid such an act, we will be
rewarded by Allaah, but if we do it, we have sinned and will be punished.

How to we know when something is Haraam? An act is considered Haraam
if Allaah or His Prophet (r) said that:

(1) It is forbidden by either using the term “forbidden” or by saying “ do not.”
For example, the Prophet (r) said, “Don _’_ t eat with your left hand, for surely
Satan eats with his left hand.”^17 Allaah said in the Qur’aan:

```
“ Forbidden to you ( in marriage) are : your mothers, your
daughters, your sister, your father ’ s sisters, your mother ’ s sisters... ”
Soorah an-Nisaa’ (4) : 23
```
(2) We should avoid it totally as Allaah stated in the Qur’aan:

17 Collected by Muslim (Sahih Muslim ( English Trans.), vol.3, p.1115, no.5010) and Abu
Daawood (Sunan Abu Dawud (English Trans.), vol.3, p.1065, no.3767).


```
“ Verily alcohol gambling and fortunetelling are filth from the work
of Satan, so avoid them totally or order to be successful. ”
Soorah al-Maa‘idah (5) : 90
```
(3) It is punishable in the Sharee _‘_ ah. ‘Uqbah ib al-Haarith said, “An-Nu _‘_ maan or
his son was brought to the Prophet (r) in state of drunkenness. The Prophet (r)
took it hard and ordered those present in the house to give him a beating. They
all took part in flogging him with the stalks of the date palm and shoes, and I was
among those who beat him. _”_^18

(4) Whoever does it will burn in Hellfire. Haarithah ibn Wahb reported that
Allaah’s Messenger (r) said, “.... Shall I inform you of the people of Hell? _”_ And
the companions replied, _“_ Yes. _”_ The Prophet (r) then said, _“_ Every haughty, fat
(from overeating) and proud person. _”_^19 Or that they will not enter Paradise, as in
the Prophet’s statement , “The gossiper will not enter Paradise.”^20

(5) It is cursed. For example, Abu Hurayrah said, “Allaah _’_ s Messenger (r)
cursed men who dressed like women and women who dressed like men. _”_^21 Ibn
Abee Mulaykah also reported that when someone asked ‘Aa’ishah if a women
could wear men’s sandals, she replied, “Allaah _’_ s Messenger ( _r_ ) cursed mannish
women. _”_^22

The purpose behind the category of Haraam acts is:

i)
to protect man from things which are extremely harmful to himself and
society, either physically (like alcohol) or spiritually (like pride).

MAIN REASONS FOR CONFLICTING
RULINGS
```
Evolution of the _Math’habs_

In the era of the Righteous Caliphs, the Fiqh principle of ijmaa (decisions by
unanimity) evolved and ijtihaad (reasoned rulings) became an independent
principle of Fiqh under the name of Qiyaas. The math _’_ hab during this period
was, in reality, that of each of the Righteous Caliphs, since the final say in legal
matters rested with them. However, all legal decisions were subject to alteration
on the basis of recorded statements or practices of the Prophet (r), i.e. hadeeths.

During the Umayyad dynasty (661-750 CE) there was a shift from caliphate
to monarchy and the caliph/king was no longer the head of the math _’_ hab. Scholars
among the companions of the Prophet (r) and their students left the centers of the
Islaamic state and dispersed in the outer lying provinces. This led to an increase in
ijtihaad as ijmaa became increasingly difficult to achieve. During this period
students of Fiqh freely and frequently changed teachers and exchanged legal
opinions. In the first hundred years of the ‘Abbaaside dynasty (750-850 CE) many
math _’_ habs flourished and though they were becoming distinct entities, they
maintained the characteristic of flexibility in making and accepting legal rulings
with existed in the previous period. Besides the current four, the Awzaa‘ee,
Laythee, Thawree, Thaahiree and Jareeree math _’_ habs were among the well-
known math _’_ habs of this period. Following the death of the major scholars the
math _’_ habs rigidity began to set in. During the latter period of the ‘Abbaaside
dynasty, between the year 950 CE and the sacking of Baghdad (1258 CE), court
debates (called Munaatharaat) between scholars of different math _’_ habs for the
entertainment of the caliphs and their entourage became popular. This spawned
competitiveness and dogmatism, since the loss of a debate not only meant the loss
of monetary reward from the caliph but it also meant the loss of personal prestige
and that of one’s math _’_ hab. Consequently, the principle of defending one’s
math _’_ hab right or wrong came to be considered a virtue. As a result, math _’_ hab
sectarianism and fanaticism became rampant among the court scholars. In time,
the spirit of rivalry largely generated by these debates spread to the masses, and
math _’_ hab factionalism became widespread.^1

Four _Madh-habs_

(^1) al-Madkhal, pp.147-57.


During this stage, the number of major math _’_ habs dwindled to four; three
major and one minor. In other words, the math _’_ habs of great Imaams like al-
Awzaa‘ee, Sufyaan ath-Thawree, Ibn Abee Laylaa, Aboo Thawr and al-Layth ibn
Sa‘d had all disappeared leaving only the math _’_ habs of Aboo Haneefah, Maalik,
ash-Shaafi‘ee and Ahmad ibn Hambal. In time, these schools of Islamic legal
thought became so predominant that the common people soon forgot that any
other schools ever existed. Furthermore, each of these schools took on a dynamic
of its own and their followers started the practice of naming themselves after their
respective math _’_ habs. For example, al-Husayin ibn Mas‘oud al-Baghawee, author
of the Fiqh classic, Sharh as-Sunnah, was commonly referred to as al-Husayn ibn
Mas‘oud al-Baghawee ash-Shaafi‘ee after the Shaafi’ee math _’_ hab.

Emergence of _Taqleed_^2

The six centuries starting with the sacking of Baghdad in 1258 CE and the
execution of the last ‘Abbaasid caliph, al-Musta‘sim, and ending around the
middle of the nineteenth century of the Christian era may be referred to as the
“Muslim Dark Ages.” It represents the rise of the Ottoman Empire, founded in
1299 CE by the Turkish leader ‘Uthmaan I, until its decline under the attacks of
European colonialism.

Scholars of this period left all forms of Ijtihaad and unanimously issued a
legal ruling which was intended to close the door of Ijtihaad permanently. They
reasoned that all possible issues had already been raised and addressed, and there
was therefore no need for further Ijtihaad.^3 With this step, a new concept of
math _’_ hab arose, namely that one of the four math _’_ habs had to be followed for
one’s Islaam to be valid. In time this concept became firmly embedded among the
masses as well as the scholars of Fiqh. Consequently, the religion of Islaam itself
became restricted within the confines of the four existing math _’_ habs; Hanafee,
Maalikee, Shaafi‘ee and Hambalee. These schools of law came to be considered
divinely ordained manifestations of Islaam. It was claimed that all of them were
completely correct, equal and representative of true Islaam, yet there were
innumerable differences among them. In fact there were scholars in this period
who interpreted some Hadeeths in such a way as to prove that the Prophet (r)
himself had predicted the appearance of the Imaams and their math _’_ habs.
Consequently, any attempt to go beyond these canonical math _’_ habs was
considered heretical and anyone who refused to follow one of them was classified
an apostate. The hyper conservative scholars of this stage even went so far as to

(^2) The blind following of a Madh-hab.

Hadeeth, 2nd ed.1968), p.12.


rule that whoever was caught transferring from one math _’_ hab to another was
liable to punishment at the discretion of the local judge. A ruling was also made in
the Hanafee math _’_ hab prohibiting the marriage of a Hanafee to a Shaafi‘ee.^4 And
even the second most important pillar of Islaam, Salaah, was not spared the
effects of math _’_ hab fanaticism. The followers of the various math _’_ habs began to
refuse to pray behind Imaams from other math _’_ habs. This resulted in the building
of separate prayer niches in the masjids^5 of communities where more than one
math _’_ hab. Even the most holy masjid, al-Masjid al-Haraam of Makkah, which
represents the unity of Muslims and the religion of Islaam, was affected. Separate
prayer niches were set up around the Ka‘bah: one for an Imaam from each of the
schools. And when the time for Salaah came, an Imaam from one of the
math _’_ habs would lead a congregation of followers from his math _’_ hab in prayer;
then another Imaam from one of the other math _’_ habs would lead his congregation
of followers and so on. Separate places of prayer for each of the math _’_ hab
remained around the Ka‘bah until the first quarter of the twentieth century when
‘Abdul-‘Azeez ibn Sa‘oud and his army conquered Makkah (October of 1924)
and united all worshippers behind a single Imaam regardless of his or their
math _’_ habs.

Consequently, all the math _’_ habs (schools of Islaamic law)contributed in
different degrees to the development of Fiqh and no single math _’_ hab can properly
be claimed to represent Islaam or Islaamic law in its totality. All of the schools
have been important instruments for the clarification and application of the
Sharee _‘_ ah. In fact, the only infallible math _’_ hab which deserves to be followed
without question is that of Prophet Muhammad (r) himself. Only his
interpretations of the Sharee _‘_ ah can rightly be considered divinely guided and
meant to be followed until the last day of this world. All other math _’_ habs are a
product of human effort, and are therefore subject to human error. Or as Imaam
ash-Shaafi‘ee, founder of the Shaafi‘ee math _’_ hab, so wisely put it, “There isn’t
any of us who hasn’t had a saying or action of Allaah’s Messenger (r) elude him
or slip his mind. So, no matter what rulings I have made or fundamental principles
I have established, there will be in them things contrary to the way of Allaah’s
Messenger (r). However, the correct ruling is according to what the Messenger of
Allaah (r) said, and that is my true ruling.”^6

Although the Imaams of the four major math _’_ habs were all agreed on the
primacy of the four fundamental principles of Islamic law (the Qur’aan, the
Sunnah, Ijmaa _‘_ and Qiyaas), certain differences have occurred and still exist

```
among the rulings of their math ’ habs. These differences arose for various reasons,
the chief ones being related to the following aspects: interpretation of word
meanings and grammatical constructions; Hadeeth narrations (availability,
authenticity, conditions for acceptance, and interpretation of textual conflict);
admissibility of certain principle (Ijmaa ‘ , customs of the Madeenites, Istihsaan,
and opinions of the Sahaabah); and methods of Qiyaas. Mention will be made of
the positions of the four existing math ’ habs where relevant.
```
1. WORD MEANINGS
The interpretational differences which occurred over the meanings of
word took three basic forms:
a) Shared Literal Meanings
There are a few words which occur in both the Qur’aan and the Sunnah with
more than literal meaning; for example, the word ق رء Qur (plural Quroo _’_ or
Aqraa’), which means menses as well as the time of purity between menses.
Thus, scholars of Fiqh were divided into two camps concerning the
interpretation of the Qur’anic verse,

**قﹸروءٍ ثﹶةﹶثﹶلﹶا بِأﹶنفﹸسِهِن يتربصن والﹾمطﹶلَّ قﹶات**

```
“ Divorced women should wait three Quroo ’. ”^7
The particular interpretation chosen makes an important difference when
considering the case of a divorced women who has started her third menses.
According to those who considered Qur ’ to be the period of purity, the divorce
becomes finalized as soon as her menses have started, while according to those
who viewed Qur ’ as the actual menses, it is not finalized until her third menses
have ended.
(i) Maalik, Ash-Shaafi‘ee and Ahmad ruled that Qur ’ meant the period
of purity.
(ii) Abu Haneefah, ruled that Qur ’ meant the actual menses.^8
```
Note:

‘Aa’eshah said, _“_ Umm Habeebah had irregular menses and she asked the
Prophet ( _r_ ) about it. He told her to stop praying during the days of the

(^7) Soorah al-Baqarah (2):228.
(^8) ‘Abdullaah ‘Abdul-Muhsin at-Turki, Asbaab Ikhtilaaf al-Fuqahaa, (Riyadh: Matba‘ah as-
Sa‘aadah, 1st ed. 1974), p.190.


Qur **_’_** s. **_”_**^9 ‘Aa’eshah was also reported to have said, “I told Bareerah to
observe a waiting period ( _‘_ Iddah) of three menses.”^10 These narrations
clearly indicate that the intended meaning of Qur _’_ is the menses itself.

b) Literal and Figurative Meanings

There are also some words in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah which have both
literal and figurative meanings. For example, the word لَمْ سٌLams (touch) is
literally used to indicate touching by the hand or the coming in contact of two
objects, and figuratively to indicate sexual intercourse. Thus, the jurists were
of three different opinions concerning the meanings of the Qur’anic verse:

**طﹶيبا يداصعِ فﹶتيمموا ماءً تجِدوا فﹶلﹶم النساءَ لﹶامستم أﹶو**

```
“ ...or you touched (Laamastum) women and can not find water, then
make Tayammum^11 from clean earth. ”^12
```
This verse occurs in the context of the factors which break the state of Wudoo.^13

(i) Ash-Shaafi‘ee and most of his students ruled that Lams meant the touch of
the hand or body contact. Therefore, if a man intentionally or accidentally
touched a woman or vice versa, skin on skin, then both of them would lose
their state of Wudoo.

(ii)Imaam Maalik and most of his students also ruled that Lams meant touching
by the hand. However, he stipulated that Wudoo would only be broken if the
touch were pleasurable, whether the touch were intended or unintended, skin
on skin or otherwise. This was also the most well known position of Imaam
Ahmad. They took the position that the deciding factor was the occurrence of
pleasure due to the existance of accurate Hadeeths stating that the Prophet (r)

used to touch his wife ‘Aa’eshah’s foot in order to move it out of the way
when he was making Sujood (prostration during prayer).^14
(iii)Imaam Abu Haneefah ruled that Lams is the verse under consideration
meant sexual intercourse and therefore, touching a woman did not break
Wudoo, whether it was accompanied by a pleasurable feeling or not.^15 This
position was based on the previously mentioned Hadeeth of ‘Aa’eshah as well
as another from her reported by the Sahaabee, ‘Urwah, that the Prophet (r)
kissed some of his wives then left for Salaah without performing Wudoo.^16
```
```
c) Grammatical Meanings
```
There were also certain grammatical constructions in Arabic which were
ambiguous. For example, the word إل ى elaa (to) could simply mean “up to but
not including”, as in the case of the Qur’aanic verse,

**اللَّ يلِ إِلﹶى الصيام أﹶتِموا ثﹸم**

```
“ And complete the fast up to (elaa) the night. ”^17
```
The fast is continued up to Maghrib (sunset), the beginning of the night, but
does not include the night itself. There is no dispute about this interpretation.
However, elaa also means “up to and including” as in the Qur’anic verse,

**وِردا جهنم إِلﹶى الﹾمجرِمِين ونسوق**

```
“ And We will drive the guilty up to (elaa) Hell like a weary herd. ”^18
Thus, Fiqh scholars held two opinions concerning the meaning of the following
Qur’anic verse describing an aspect of the performance of Wudoo:
```
**الﹾمرافِقِ إِلﹶى وأﹶيدِيكﹸم وجوهكﹸم فﹶاغﹾسِلﹸوا**

```

2. NARRATIONS OF HADEETHS

The causes of legal differences which developed among jurists over the narration
and application of Hadeeths may be subdivided as follows:

a) Availability of Hadeeths

There were numerous cases where certain narrations of Hadeeths, did not reach
some of the scholars, due to the fact that the Sahaabah who narrated them had
settled in various regions throughout the Islamic empire, and the major Madh-
habs were founded in different parts of the empire before the comprehensive
compilations of Hadeeths were made. To be more specific, the Madh-hab of Abu
Haneefah (702-767 CE), Maalik (717-855 CE), Ash-Shaafi‘ee and Ahmad (778-
855 CE) were founded between the middle of the eighth century (CE and the early
part of the ninth, whereas the most authentic and comprehensive compilations of
Hadeeth (the Sound Six^23 ) were not available until the latter part of the ninth
century and the early decades of the tenth.

(i)
Abu Haneefah ruled that Istisqaa (Prayer for rain) did not include formal
congregational prayer (Salaah). His position was based on the narration of
Anas ibn Maalik in which the Prophet (r), on an occasion, made a

spontaneous Du ‘ aa (supplication) for rain without making Salaah.^24
```
```
However, his students Abu Yousuf and Muhammad and the other Imaams
all agreed that Salaah for Istisqaa was correct.^25 Their position was based
on the narration of ‘Abbaad ibn Tameem and other in which the Prophet
(r) was reported to have gone out to the prayer area, made Du ‘ aa for rain
facing the Qiblah (direction of Makkah), reversed his cloak and led the
people in two units of Salaah.^26
```
b) Weak Narrations of Hadeeths

There were cases where some jurists based their rulings on Hadeeths which were
in fact Da _‘_ eef (weak and unreliable), because they were unaware of the
unreliability of those Hadeeths or because they took the position that a weak
Hadeeth was to be preferred to their Qiyaas (analogical deduction).^27 For
example.

(i)

(ii)

```
Imaam Abu Haneefah, his companions and Imaam Ahmad ibn Hambal all
held that the state of Wudoo is broken by vomiting basing their ruling on a
Hadeeth attributed to ‘Aa’eshah in which she reportedly claimed that the
Prophet (r) had said, “ Whoever is afflicted by Qay, Ru ‘ aaf or Qals
(different forms of vomiting) should leave (the Salaah), make Wudoo, then
continue where he left off without speaking during. ”^28
```
```
Imaam ash-Shaafi‘ee and Imaam Maalik ruled for two reasons that Qay ’
(vomit) did not break Wudoo: First, the above mentioned Hadeeth was not
authentic and second, Qay ’ is not specifically mentioned in other sources
of Islamic law as an act which breaks Wudoo.
```
c) Conditions for the Acceptance of Hadeeths

Da _‘_ eef al-Jaami _‘_ as-Sagheer (Beirut: al-Maktab al-Islaamee, 1979), vol.5, p.167, no.5434.


Other differences among jurists in the area of the Sunnah arose from
various conditions they placed on its acceptability. For example, Imaam Abu
Haneefah stipulated that a Hadeeth had to be Mash-hoor (well known) before
being regarded as admissible evidence, whereas Imaam Maalik stipulated that
Hadeeth must not contradict the customs of the Madeenites in order to be
admissible. On the other hand. Imaam Ahmad considered Mursal^29 Hadeeths
acceptable as proof, while Imaam ash-Shaafi‘ee accepted only the Mursal
Hadeeths of Sa‘eed ibn al-Mussayib which most Hadeeth scholars felt were
highly authentic.^30

d) Resolution of Textual Conflict in Hadeeths

The founders of the Madh-habs and their students took two main approaches in
resolving apparent contradictions between the literal meanings of some of the
recorded narrations of Hadeeth. Some jurists chose the path of _“_ Tarjeeh _”_ which
meant giving preference to some Hadeeths while rejecting others on the same
topic. On the other hand, some of the other jurists chose the path of Jama _‘_ , which
involved combining such Hadeeths using one in a general sense. For example,
there is an authentic Hadeeth in which the Prophet (r) forbade Salaah at certain
times saying; “No Salaah (is allowed) after Fajr prayer until the sun has risen
and after _‘_ Asr prayer until the sun has set. _”_^31 At the same time there are other
equally authentic Hadeeths in which certain Salaahs were recommended without
time restriction. For example, _“_ If any of you enters a masjid, he should pray two
Raka _‘_ aat (units of prayer) before sitting down. _”_^32

(i)
Imaam Abu Haneefah gave preference to the first Hadeeth and ruled that
all forms of Salaah were forbidden during the forbidden times.

(^29) Hadeeth reported by one of the students of the Sahaabah without mentioning the name of the
Sahaabee from whom he had heard it.

Bukhari (Arabic-English Trans.), vol.1, p.322, no.555). Muslim (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.),

no.1271).
(^32) Reported by Abu Qataadah and collected by al-Bukhaaree (Sahih Al-Bukhari, (Arabic-English),
vol.1, pp.259-60, no.435), Muslim (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), vol.1, p.347, no.1540) and
Abu Daawood (Sunan Abu Dawud (English Trans.), vol.1, p.120, no.467).


(ii)

```
Imaam Maalik, Imaam ash-Shaafi‘ee and Imaam Ahmad combined the two
Hadeeths, ruling that the first Hadeeth was general and referred to
voluntary Salaah (Nafl), whereas the second Hadeeth was specific,
allowing highly recommended Salaah (Mustahabb) even during the
generally forbidden times.^33
```
3. ADMISSIBILITY OF CERTAIN PRINCIPLES

There was among the Imaams some who developed a number of
controversial principles on which they based some of their rulings. As a result,
both the rulings and the principles became sources of differences among jurists.
For example, the majority of jurists recognized the validity of Ijmaa _‘_ among the
generations after the Sahaabah, but Imaam ash-Shaafi‘ee questioned its
occurrence while Imaam Ahmad rejected it outright. Similarly Imaam Maalik’s
reliance on the customs of the Madeenites as a source of legislation was rejected
by the majority of jurists. And, Imaam Abu Haneefah’s principle of Istihsaan and
Maalik’s Istislaah were both disallowed by Imaam ash-Shaafi‘ee as being too
independent of the Qur’aan, the Sunnah, and Ijmaa _‘_. That is to say, they relied too
much, in his opinion, on human reasoning. On the other hand, Imaam ash-
Shaafi‘ee felt that the opinion of the Sahaabah had to be accepted on legal
matters, while others felt that it was only reasoning on their part which was not
binding on the later generations.^34

4. METHODS OF QIYAAS

The various approaches which jurists took in their application of Qiyaas
were perhaps the largest source of differences among them. Some narrowed down
the scope of Qiyaas by setting a number of preconditions for its use, while others
expanded its scope. Because this principle was based on opinion to a greater
extent than any of the others, there were no hard and fast rules with which to
contain it, and thus a wide range of differences developed.”^35

(^33) The latter position is supported by the Prophet (r) practise of praying missed voluntary prayers
of DHuhur after the compulsory prayers of ‘Asr which was reported Umm Salamah and collected
by al-Bukhaaree (Sahih Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English) vol.1, p.325, chapter 33) and Muslim (Sahih
Muslim (English Trans.), vol.2, pp.397-8, no.1815). See also Bidaayah al-Mujtahid, vol.1, pp.66-

4.6 DIFFERENCES AMONG THE UMMAH

Any study of the historical development of Math _’_ habs, schools of Islamic legal
thought, will readily show their overall contributions to the progressive
enrichment and unifying character of Fiqh within the Muslim world. The liberal
thinking which characterized the early Imaams and their Math _’_ habs, from the
time of the Prophet (r) down through the ages, was steadily replaced by a certain
rigidity and dogmatism. Since the late thirteenth century, not only have the
Math _’_ habs become spawning grounds of sectarianism, but Fiqh has lost its
original vitality which was enshrined in the principle of Ijtihaad and thus it has
not been able to keep pace with changing circumstances. As a result of Math _’_ hab
sectarianism and Fiqh inflexibility, the traditional purity, unity and dynamism of
Islaam have been threatened throughout the Muslim world.

In the material of this section we will examine the phenomenon of
differences and disagreement (Ikhtilaaf) in the light of the positions of early
scholars and their students. The goal being the realization that while differences
of opinion among scholars are inevitable, unreasoning disagreement and
sectarianism have no place in the religion of Islaam which Allaah in His wisdom
revealed to His Prophet (r).

In treating the historical development (and evolution) of the Math _’_ habs
and the concurrent growth of Fiqh into a full-fledged Islamic science, it is evident
that the great Imaams and founders of the Math _’_ habs generally adopted the stand
that:

(a) Math _’_ habs singly or in their totality were not infallible and

(b) the following of any one Math _’_ hab was not obligatory for Muslims.

Yet the pervasive influence of Taqleed has resulted, among other things,
in a complete turnabout, so much so, that for centuries now the position taken by
the generality of Muslims is that the four Math _’_ habs are divinely ordained and
therefore infallible; the legal rulings of each of those Math _’_ habs are all sound and
correct; everyone must follow one of the four Math _’_ habs; a Muslim should not
change his or her Math _’_ hab; and it is wrong to pick and choose rulings across
Math _’_ habs. As a corollary to these beliefs, it has been stated that anyone who
dares openly to deny the infallibility of all four Math _’_ habs or the obligation to
follow one of these Math _’_ habs is considered an accursed innovator and apostate.

In the 20th century the most commonly used epithet for describing such an
apostate has been the label Wahhabi (pronounced Wahhaabee). Another similarly
abusive term which is used mostly in India and Pakistan is Ahl-i-Hadeeth,


Incidentally, both of these terms are in reality misnomers, as the following
explanatory comments will reveal.

In the years 1924-25 the followers of Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab
(1703-1787) zealously destroyed all structures built over graves of the Sahaabah
and other revered persons in the cemeteries of the holy cities of Makkah and
Madeenah. The so called Wahhabis were also opposed to Tawassul (seeking
intercession from the dead), which had become a widespread practice among the
masses of Muslims as well as among many scholars. Since Tawassul and the
attachment to monuments and shrines had long been ingrained in the Muslim
world, the destructive act of the Wahhabis in 1924-25 appeared to be innovative
and extremist; hence the application of the epithet Wahhabi to “accursed
innovators” and “apostates.” It should be noted, however, that Ibn ‘Abdul-
Wahhaab, founder of the Wahhabi movement, followed the Fiqh of the Hambalee
Madh-hab and that his present-day followers continue to do so.

Furthermore, in opposing Tawassul and destroying monuments and
shrines to the dead, the twentieth-century descendants and followers of Ibn
‘Abdul-Wahhaab were attacking anti-Islamic practices. The Prophet (r) had
ordered the demolition of all idols and statues, and the levelling of all tombs with
the surrounding earth, according to an authentic Hadeeth reported by ‘Alee ibn
Abee Taalib and collected by the great Hadeeth scholar Muslim ibn Hajjaaj.^1
From the above it should now be clear that the word Wahhabi applied to mean
“accursed innovator” and “apostate” is the fact a mislabel.

Similarly, the term Ahl-i-Hadeeth (Ar.Ahl al-Hadeeth) was a title of
respect and praise given to scholars in the past who like Imaam Maalik, devoted
much time and effort to the specialized study of Hadeeth. Towards the end of the
nineteenth century this title was adopted by a reform movement in India and
Pakistan which called for a return to the Qur’aan and the Hadeeth as the basis of
Fiqh and which opposed the dogmatic adherence to Madh-habs. However, present
day Madh-hab fanaticism and sectarianism have distorted the meaning of the term
Ahl-i-Hadeeth to apply to one who fanatically opposes the following of any of the
Madh-habs.

The irony is that, in light of our insight into the historical evolution of the
Madh-habs and concurrent development of Fiqh, the true deviants from the
teachings of Islaam are not the so-called Wahhabi and Ahl-i-Hadeeth, but those
people who would rigidly insist on every Muslim following one or another of the

(^1) Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), vol.2, p.459, no.2115. See also Sunan Abu Dawud (English
Trans.), vol.2, pp.914-5, no.3212. The text of the Hadeeth is narrated by Abu al-Hayyaaj al-
Asadee who reported that ‘Alee ibn Abee Taalib said to him “Shall I send you as the Messenger of
Allaah sent me? To deface every statue or picture in houses and level all elevated graves. **_”_**


four Madh-habs and on their believing blindly in the infallibility of all four Madh-
habs, despite certain glaring contradictions in their rulings on points of Islamic
law. Yet it must be acknowledge that those who advocate blind following
(Taqleed), are often very sincere in their belief in the infallibility of all four
Madh-habs. Furthermore many scholars are included in their ranks.^2

How then do those who insist on Taqleet reconcile the known differences
and contradictions from Madh-hab to Madh-hab with their belief in the
infallibility of all four Madh-habs? Some of them claim that the Madh-habs were
divinely ordained and the Prophet (r) himself prophesied their coming. Most
often, however, they rest their case, mainly on the evidence of the following
Hadeeths:

((رحمةﹲ أﹸمتِى اِختِلاﹶف ))

(a) _“_ Disagreement among my nation is a mercy. _”_

(b) _“_ Differences among my Sahaabah are a mercy for you. _”_^3

(^2) Under the heading Taqleed Restricted to the Four Mathaa-hib, the author of Taqleed and
Ijtihaad writes: “ It was realized from the exposition of the Wujoob of Taqleed that adoption of
different verdicts leads to anarchy. It is therefore, imperative to make Taqleet of Math-hab which
has been so formulated and arranged in regard to principle (Usool) and details (Furoo _’_ ) that
answers to all questions could be obtained. Thereby obviating the need to refer to an external
source. This all-embracing quality, by an act of Allaah Ta _‘_ ala, is found existing in only the four
Mathaa-hib. It is therefore, imperative to adopt one of four Mathaa-habs. _”_ Maulana Muhammad

who follows anything over which they (the Sahaabah) have differed, as far as
I am concerned, he will be following guidance. _”_^6

However, before these Hadeeths can be accepted as evidence for sectarianism,
they must be clearly shown to be authentic. An examination of these Hadeeths has
indeed been made by eminent scholars and their conclusions are recorded
hereafter.

As for the Hadeeth in which the Prophet (r) was supposed to have
foretold the coming of the Imaams and their Madh-habs, the authentic ones are all
generally worded with no specific mention of either the names of the Imaams or
their Madh-habs, while those Hadeeths that are specifically worded are all
fabricated.^7

With regard to _“_ Hadeeth _”_ (a) above, it has no chain of narration
connecting it to anyone, much less to the Prophet (r); not is it to be found in any
of the books of Hadeeth.^8 It is therefore incorrect to even refer to it as a Hadeeth,
as it is fabricated. With regard to _“_ Hadeeths _”_ (b) to (e) above, although they can
be found in books of Hadeeth or about Hadeeth, they have all proven to be
unauthentic. The first is classified by Hadeeth scholars as Waahin (extremely
weak),^9 the second and third as Mawdoo _‘_ (fabricated)^10 and the fourth as Baatil
(false).^11 Thus, the Hadeeth evidence for the glorification and perpetuation of
differences among Madh-habs, is totally unacceptable from the point of view of
authenticity.

(^6) Allegedly reported by Ibn ‘Umar and collected by Ibn Battah in al-Ibaanah, Ibn ‘Asaakir, and
NidHaam al-Mulk in al-Amaalee and quoted in Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth ad-Da _‘_ eefah, vol.1, pp.80-1.
(^7) For example al-Khateeb collected a Hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (r) through Abu Hurayrah
in which he was supposed to have said, _“_ There will be among my Ummah a man called Abu
Haneefah, he will be the lamp of my Ummah. _”_ Al-Khateebs himself and al-Haakim declared it
Mawdoo _‘_ (forged), among the fabrications of Muhammad ibn Sa‘eed al-Marwazee (Muhammad

1972), p.320, no.1226). Al-Khateeb collected another report through Anas in which the Prophet
(r) was quoted as saying, _“_ There will come after me a man called an-Nu _‘_ maan ibn Thaabit, pet-
named Abu Haneefah. Allaah _’_ s religion and my Sunnah will be revived by him. _”_ It has in its chain
of narrators Ahmad al-Juwaybaaree, a known fabricator of Hadeeths and Muhammad ibn Yazeed

Not only are these so-called Hadeeths unauthentic , but their very
meanings are in obvious conflict with the Qur’aan itself. Throughout the
Qur’aan’s one hundred and fourteen chapters, Allaah has clearly cursed and
forbidden religious disagreement and has ordered unity and agreement.
Disagreement has been explicity forbidden in verses such as:

**رِيحكﹸم وتذﹾهب فﹶتفﹾشلﹸوا تنازعوا ولﹶا**

```
“ Do not dispute among yourselves and cause your own failure and

and

```
Do not be like those among the idolaters who split up their religion
into sects, each group happy with what they had. ”^13
```
Implicity, too, Allaah has forbidden it, for example,

“ If you Lord had so willed, He could have made mankind one
people; but they will not cease to dispute, except those on whom your
Lord has bestowed His mercy. ”^14
```
If Allaah’s mercy puts an end to dispute among men as is implied in the above,
how then could disagreement and dispute be a mercy? In the unmistakable terms
of the following verse and others like it, Allaah has ordered unity and agreement:

Differences Among the _Sahaabah_

In view of these clear Qur’anic condemnations, how then do we account
for the disagreement which occurred at times among the Prophet’s (r) companions
(Sahaabah) and the early scholars of Fiqh?

The differences of opinion which occurred among the Sahaabah were for
the most part natural and unavoidable. A large portion of it was due to their
different reasoning abilities which showed up in their various interpretations of
Qur’aanic verses and Hadeeths. There were other causes which led to differences
during their time which later disappeared; for example, the wide distribution of
Hadeeths made it impossible for any individual Sahaabee to be aware of them all,
and thus wrong decisions were bound to be made where information was lacking.
Obviously, they cannot be blamed for these and similar mistakes, which were not
intentional. Furthermore, it is clear that they readily corrected their wrong
decisions when authentic information or more relevant evidence indicated that
this should be done. It is this willingness to cast aside wrong decisions in the
search for truth which excludes these conflicting rulings from the category of
accursed disagreements. In this connection, the Messenger of Allaah (r) had said,

_“_ If a judge strives his utmost and makes a correct ruling, he receives two
rewards, but if he strives and errs he still receives one. _”_^16 Based on this Hadeeth,
the Sahaabah are considered absolved from blame for conflicting rulings.
However, any discrepancies apparent in their different rulings are not to be
glorified and perpetuated. In fact they themselves disliked disagreements, as is
shown in the following narration quoted by ash-Shaafi‘ee’s student, at-Muzanee:
‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, the second Righteous Caliph, got angry because of a
dispute between the Sahaabee, Ubayy ibn Ka‘b, and another Sahaabee, Ibn
Mas‘ood, over the performance of Salaah in a single piece of cloth. Ubayy
considered it quite all right while Ibn Mas‘ood felt that was so only when cloth
was scarce. ‘Umar angrily left his residence and declared, “Have two of Allaah’s
messenger’s companions disagreed and they are among those whom the masses

(^15) Soorah Aal ‘Imraan (3):103.
(^16) Narrated by ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al ‘Aas and collected by al-Bukhaaree (Sahih Al-Bukhari,
(Arabic-English), vol.4, p.442, no.667) and Muslim (Sahih Muslim (English Trans.), vol.3, p.930,
no.4261).


watch closely and imitate? Ubayy is correct and Ibn Mas‘ood should desist! If I
hear of anyone disputing about this matter after his point, I will deal with him.”^17

Indeed, the early scholars well aware of the causes of differences among
the Sahaabah and the tendency for people to want to perpetuate them.
Accordingly, they made definitive statements on the matter in an effort to stave
off dogmatism and sectarianism based on conflicting rulings of the Sahaabah.
The following are a few examples of their statements on this vital subject. Ibn al-
Qaasim, who was among the main students of Imaam Maalik, said, _“_ I heard
Maalik and al-Layth both say the following concerning the differences among the
Sahaabah: _‘_ People say there is leeway for them in it, but it is not so; it was a case
of wrong and right rulings. _”_^18

Ash-hab, another of Imaam Maalik’s students, said, _“_ Maalik was once
asked whether one was safe to follow a ruling related to him by reliable narrators
who had heard it from companions of the Prophet ( _r_ ). He replied, _‘_ No, by Allaah,
not unless it is correct: the truth is only one. Can two opposing opinions be
simultaneously correct? The opinion which is correct can be only one. _”_^19

Imaam ash-Shaafi‘ee’s student, al-Muzanee, put it this way, _“_ The
companions of Allaah _’_ s Messenger ( _r_ ) disagreed from time to time and declared
each other mistaken. Some of them examined the statements of others and
researched them thoroughly. Therefore, if all of them felt that whatever they said
was correct, they would never have investigated each other _’_ s statements or
declared each other mistaken. _”_ Al-Muzanee also said, _“_ The following question
should be put to the one who allows disagreement, claiming that if two scholars
strive to arrive at a decision concerning the same incident one ruling that it is
_“_ Halaal _”_ and the other that it is _“_ Haraam _”_ , both are correct. _‘_ Are you basing
that judgement on a fundamental text (the Qur _’_ aan or the Sunnah) or on Qiyaas
(analogical deduction)? _’_ If he claims that it is based on a fundamental text, he
should then be asked, _‘_ How could it be based on a fundamental text when the
Qur _’_ aan, (which is the major fundamental text) condemns disagreement? _’_ If he
claims that it is by Qiyaas, he should be asked, _‘_ How could the fundamental text
reject dispute and you in turn deduce from It that dispute is allowed? _’_ No
common person capable of reason would allow that, much less a scholar. _”_^20

Although the Sahaabah differed in the application of some principles, they
used to go to extremes to preserve an appearance of unity and avoid things which
would divide their ranks. But, among later scholars and followers who blindly and

dogmatically clung to the inherited Madh-habs, we find the complete opposite. As
was previously mentioned, their differences at one point led to the splitting of
their ranks over Salaah (formal prayer), the greatest pillar of Islaam after the two
testimonies of belief.”^21
