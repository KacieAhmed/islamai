Foreward
All praise is due only to Allaah. We laud Him and beseech
His aid and beg forgiveness only from Him and believe in
Him and rely solely on Him. We seek salvation in Him
from the evils of our inner selves and the vices of our
actions. There is none to misguide one whom Allaah
intends to guide. I bear witness that there is no one worthy
of worship but Allaah, the One who has no partner. I also
testify that Hadhrat Muhammad ρ is the faithful servant
and the Last Rasul of Allaah. May Allaah Ta’ala’s mercy
be on him, his family and his Sahabaah (Radia Allahu
Anhum Ajmaeen) and may He bless them and raise their
status.

By the Grace of Allaah the translation of “Aqaaidul
Tahawi,” with the excellent commentary by Hadhrat
Muhammad Qari Tayyob (A.R) is in your hands. We have
included :-
1.) Information on Imaam Tahawi (A.R);
2.) Brief History on Qari Tayyob (A.R);
3.) Used our “Quraan Made Easy” translation basics
for the Ayats;
4.) Inserted the necessary Quraanic reference which
are not present in the original ;

We have made the translation easy to follow and simple to
understand. Also creating further sub – divisions in the text
format to enable readers to follow through systematically.
Example, if the text has 3 points with 3 separate
commentaries, we tried as far as possible were practical to
separate the 3 point text into 1 point beneath which the
relative respective commentary follows.

This work with it commentary from the Quraan, Ahadeeth
and sound logically elucidation should be utilized as a
standard text book for higher learning.

The current deviant sects and ideologies when examined
carefully will reveal that actually and in reality these are
but the off shoots and siblings of the older by-gone false
concepts of the confused sects which have been mentioned
both in the text (matn) and its valuable commentary. One
who studies properly and diligently will be able face and
answer the objections, challenges, misgivings and false
interpretations of the current flood of “Baatil” (erroneous)
sects, which are misled and mis-leading.

We make duaa for all who brought this dynamic work to
see the light of the day.

We request readers not to forget us in their duaas.

Allaah guides whomsoever He wants towards the Haqq.

Imaam Al Tahawi
Imaam Abu Ja’far al Tahawi (239 – 321) can be said to
represent the creed of both Ash’aris and Maturidis,
especially the latter, as he was also following the Hanafi
Madhab.

Imaam Abu Ja’far Ahmad ibn Muhammad al –Azdi,
known as Imaam Tahawi after his birthplace in Egypt, is
among the most outstanding authorities of the Islaamic
world on Hadith and jurisprudence (fiqh). He lived at a
time when both the direct and indirect disciples of the Four
Imaams of law were teaching and practicing. This period
was the greatest age of Hadith and fiqh studies, and Imaam
Tahawi studied with all the living authorities of the day. Al
Badr al Ayni said that Imaam Tahawi was 12 when Ahmad
passed away, 27 when Bukhari passed away, 32 when
Muslim passed away, 44 when Ibn Majah passed away, 46
when Abu Dawood passed away, 50 when Tirmidhi passed
away, 74 when Nis’aa passed away. Kawthari relates this
and adds the consensus of scholars that Tahawi allied in
himself in the two knowledge’s of Hadith and fiqh, a
consensus that included, among others, al – Ayni and al –
Dhahabi. Ibn Kathir says in his notice on Tahawi in “Al
Bidaya wa al Nihaya:” “He is one of the trustworthy
narrators of established reliability and one of the massive
memorizes of Hadith.” Kawthari states: “No – one
disregards Tahawi’s knowledge of the defective Hadith
except someone whose own defects have no remedy, and
may Allaah protect us from such.”

Tahawi began his studies with his maternal uncle Isma’il
ibn Yahya al Muzani, a leading disciple of Imam Shafi’i.
However, Tahawi felt instinctively drawn to the corpus of
Imaam Abu Hanifa’s works. Indeed, he has seen his uncle

and teacher turning to the works of Hanafi scholars to
resolve thorny issues of fiqh, drawing heavily on the
writing of Abu Hanifa’s two leading companions,
Muhammad Ibn al- Hasan al Shaybani and Abu Yusuf,
who had codified Hanafi fiqh. This led him to devote his
whole attention to studying the Hanafi works and he
eventually joined the Hanafi school. He now stands out not
only as a prominent follower of that Hanafi school but, in
view of his vast erudition and remarkable powers of
assimilation, as one of its leading scholars. His
monumental scholarly works, such as “Sharh Ma’ami al –
athar” and “Mushkil al – athar” are encyclopedic in scope
and have long been regarded as indispensable for training
students of fiqh. He was in fact a mujtahid across the board
and was thoroughly familiar with the fiqh of all four
shools, as stated by Ibn ‘Abd al – Barr and related by
Kawthari, and as shown by Tahawi’s own work on
comparative law entitled “Ikhtilaf al fuqaha.”

Tahawi’s “Doctrine” (al- Aqida), though small in size, is a
basic text for all times, listing what a Muslim must know
and believe and inwardly comprehend. There is consensus
among the Companions, the Successors and all the leading
Islaamic authorities such as the four Imaam and their
authoritative followers on the doctrines enumerated in this
work, which are entirely derived from the undisputed
primary sources of Deen, the Noble Quraan and the
confirmed Hadith. Being a text in Islaamic doctrine, this
work sums up the arguments set forth in those two sources
to define sound belief, and likewise, the arguments
advanced in refuting the views of sects that have deviated
from the Sunnah.
As regards the sects mentioned in this work, familiarity
with Islaamic history up to the time of Imaam Tahawi
would be quite helpful. More or less veiled references to

sects such as the Mu’tazila, the Jahmiyya, the Karramiyya,
the Qadariyya, and the Jabariyya are found in the work, It
also contains allusions to other views considered
unorthodox and deviant from the way of Ahl al Sunnah.
There is an explicit reference in the work to the
controversy on the creation of the Quraan in the times of al

Ma’mun and others.
While the permanent relevance of the statements of belief
in the “Aqida” are obvious, the historical weight and point
of certain of these statements can be properly appreciated
only if the work is used as a text for study under the
guidance of some learned person able to elucidate its
arguments fully, with reference to the intellectual and
historical background of the sects refuted in the work.
Since the present book is intended exactly as one such aid
towards understanding the details of Islaamic belief with
clarity, it is hoped that the quotation of the entire text of
Tahawi’s “Doctrine,” which we consider as the doctrine of
Ahl al Sunna wa al Jamaa’a, will be of benefit to the
reader. And may Allah grant us a true understanding of
faith and count us among those described by Nabi ρ as the
Saved Group. Kawthari, Maqdat L 500

The original author, Al Tahwi, was a scholar of Hadith and
a jurist. He was born in 293 in Egypt. His mentor was his
uncle Isma’il b. Yahya al Muzani who was one of the most
learned disciple of Imam Shafi. However, subsequently,
Tahawi parted ways with his uncle to adopt the Hanafiyy
school of thought, although that did not prevent him from
differing with certain opinions of Imaam Abu Hanifah
himself in preference of opinions of others.

Tahawi also studied under various Hadith scholars whose
number reaches three hundred. Understandably, several

scholars of repute have showered praise on Tahawi. Ibn
Yunus said: “Tahawi was a trustworthy, well-known,
intelligent scholar who was not succeeded by a scholar of
his stature.” This single opinion should suffice since the
opinions of Ibn Yunus are considered to be well
deliberated statements of fact, especially when he is talking
about scholars of Egyptian origin.

Nonetheless, Dhahabi too has stated in his “Tarikh al
Kabir” that Al Tahawi was an outstanding, intelligent
scholar of repute. Ibn Kathir has said about him in his “Al
Bidayah wa al Nihayah” that “he was one of the most
brilliant and trustworthy scholars of Hadith.”

The outstanding qualities of his writings are a thorough
research, abundance of material and an attractive manner
of presentation.

One of his works is “Aqidah al Tahawiyyah,” which is in
the hands of the reader. The textual material, although a
short discourse, is compressed with meaning. It follows the
methodology of the pious predecessors and is framed in
words that can neither be easily misinterpreted nor will
soon empty out their meaning to become sterile.

Another of his book is “Ma ani al Athar.” This is a
collection of essays of legal nature where he states a rule
and then substantiates it with the help of various evidence.
In the course of discussions he also takes up those legal
matters over which disagreement prevailed among the
jurists, presenting various points of view and then, finally,
states his own preference. This work inculcates in the
reader a capacity for research and higher learning, raising
his intellectual capabilities.

Another of his works is “Mushkil al Athar” in which he
presents such traditions of the Nabi, on whom be peace,
that seem to contradict each other. He endeavors, with
great success, to show how they could be reconciled.

Yet another of his works is “Mukhtasar fi al Fiqh Ala Furu
al Hanafiyyah” which deals with certain derivative
principles of Law.

Besides these published works there are several others to
his credit.

He passed away in 321 AH. May Allaah be pleased with
him.

Moulana Qari Muhammad Tayyib (A.R).
Birth
Moulana Muhammad Ahmad Qasimi (R.A) (1346 AH),
the son of Moulana Qasim Nanotwi (R.A) was a great
scholar of Islaam. He was the principal of Darul Ulum
Deoband for forty years. Initially he has two sons and a
daughter who passed away in their infancy. Thereafter, for
a long period, he had no offspring. The elders of Darul
Ulum were concerned because they wanted the progeny of

Moulana Qasim Nanotwi (R.A) to continue. Moulana
Abdus Sami (R.A) an ustadh at Darul Ulum, said that
Sheikhul Hind (R.A) called him one day and told him to go
to Fatehpur to a saint whose du’as were accepted to
supplicate for Moulana Muhammad Ahmad (R.A).
Moulana Abdus Sami (R.A) did as he was requested. The
saint asked him to come the next day.

When Moulana Abdus Sami (R.A) went to see him the
next day, the saint said that he had supplicated and that his
du’ad had been accepted. He also remarked that he was
given the glad tiding that Moulana Muhammad Ahmad
(R.A) would have a son who would become a Hafiz, Qari,
Alim and a Haji. The du’a manifested itself in the form of
Qari Muhammad Tayyib (R.A) who was born in Jumadath
Thaniyah 1315 AH (1897) in Deoband. His ancestral tree
links up with Sayyidina Abu Bakr τ. His grandfather,
Hujjatul Islaam, Moulana Muhammad Qasim Nanotwi
(R.A) was a famous saint and scholar of the Islaamic world
who laid the foundation of Darul Uloom Deoband in 1867.

Education
Qari Tayyib (A.R) was admitted to Darul Uloom in 13 22
AH. All the great elders attended his admission ceremony
where Bismillaah was recited to commence his education.
He was seven years old at the time. Qari Abdul Wahid
Khan Illahabadi (A.R) was chosen for the task of teaching
him the recitation of the Noble Quraan. He completed
memorizing the Quraan at the tender age of eleven in 1326
A. He had a loud and melodious voice from his youth and
the teachers would listen with great enthuthiasm to his
recitation. Moulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi (A.R) used to
call him to recite the Quraan. Hadhrat Gangohi (A.R) was

extremely pleased with his recitation and would make
plenty of du’as for him.

From amongst his mentors were ‘Allamah Kashmiri, Mufti
Azizur Rahmaan Uthmaani, Moulana Habibur Rahmaan,
Allamah Shabbir Ahmad Uthmani and Moulana Asghar
Husain (A.R). Qari Tayyib (A.R) said that he procured the
enthusiasm for Hadith from his father who had an expert
ability in explanations. He obtained the ability to explain
the meanings of the Ahadeeth from Allamah Kashmiri
(A.R) and the style of expressing the laws (Mas’aail) from
Allaamah Shabir Ahmad Uthmani (A.R) who was most
eloquent. He qualified in 1337 AH (1918).

Qari Tayyib (A.R) also had an interest in self defence and
military tactics which he learnt from a pious saint Amir
Shah Khan.

Spirituality
In 1339 AH he took ba’yah (pledge of allegiance) at the
hands of Sheikhul Hind (A.R) when the latter was just
released from Malta. Sheikhul Hind (A.R) passed away
five months later. Qari Tayyib (A.R) then turned to
Allamah Kashmiri (A.R) for spiritual guidance. The latter
did not make Qari Tayyib (A.R) take bay’ah but continued
guiding him. Moulana Habibur Rahmaan Uthmani (A.R)
suggested to Qari Tayyib (A.R) to take bay’ah at the hands
of Hadhrat Thanwi (A.R), which he did. In 1350 AH
Hakimul Ummat, Hadhrat Thanwi (A.R) conferred the
mantle of Khilafat on him.

Services to Deen.
When Qari Tayyib (A.R) first went to Bombay, the Ahle
Bid’ah (innovators) spread allegations against him and
labeled him the worst kafir since he was related to all the
elders of Deoband due to being their student or being
related to them. Coincidentally, when he delivered a talk,
more than 30 000 people attended it. He spoke for
approximately three hours and in this while completely
over whelmed the audience. After this speech, he was
invited to all parts of Bombay to deliver talks especially in
areas where the opponents were very vociferous against
the Ulama e Deoband. This series of talks lasted for 29
days. Large crowds attended his talks and Moulana
Ibrahim Balyawi (A.R) conferred the title of “Fatih
Bombay” (the conqueror of Bombay) to Qari Tayyib.

The condition of the people of Bombay before this was
such that if any Deobandi Alim visited any Masjid, they
would wash the Masjid after his departure. After Qari
Tayyib’s programmes, the people who pointed a pistol at
Moulana Abdush Shakur (A.R) threateningly, now took
Bay’ah at the hands of Qari Tayyib (A.R) and repented
from all their evil acts.

He was appointed the vice chancellor of Darul Uloom in
1341 AH during his teaching days. Then in 1348 AH he
was appointed the chancellor. During his tenure as the
chancellor, Darul Ulum progressed tremendously.

Besides his service to Deen in the form of teaching, he was
an outstanding orator. His talks became popular from his
student days. He could easily speak on any Islaamic
subject no matter how intricate for two to three hours
without any hesitation. His specialty was in unveiling the
secrets of Shariah.

From among his contemporaries were Mufti Shafi (A.R),
Allamah Idris Kandhelwi (A.R) and Moulana Badre Alam
Mirthi (A.R).

He penned many works some of which are: “Science and
Islaam,” “Talimate Islaam,” “The Philosophy of Salah”
and “Tarikh Darul Ulum Deoband.” His “Mawaa’iz” and
“Majaalis” have also been published.
Demise

During his last hours, Mufti Sa’id Ahmad and Moulana
Salim were present. Qari Tayyib (R.A) was completely at
ease. There was no sign of any tension on him nor was
there any groaning. Moulana Muhammad Ishaq (A.R), the
proprietor of Kutub Khanah Rahimiyah came during the
final moments when Hakim Mahmud was asking Qari
Tayyib (A.R) about his condition and the latter was
replying. This indicated that he was at some ease. Hakim
Mahmud placed his hand on Qari Tayyib’s stomach to
make a diagnosis. The latter breathed for about one and a
half minutes and then passed away. The people that were
present did not even realize that he had left this world. This
was in the month of Shawwaal 1403 AH (July 1983).

AQEEDATUT TAHAAWI
“We say about Allaah’s Unity^1 believing - by Allaah’s
help^2 - that Allaah is One^3 "
1). The Author begins with Towheed, because it is the
first tenet from amongst the tenets of Islaam, and it is the
first fundamental from amongst the fundamentals of Islaam
and Belief. It is the first thing that is binding upon a
(mature) believer, and it is the first Dawat (invitation) of all the Ambiyaa ا$#"م '()*+ to their respective nations, era after era, age after age. To such an extent that Allaah Subhaanahu Wataala had firstly testified to this Himself,
secondly, the angels have testified to this and thirdly, the
knowledgeable ones have testified to this.

Allaah Taala states in the Quraan:

"Allaah is Witness (He clearly proves to His creation)
that there is no Ilaah but Him and the angels and men of
knowledge (are also witnesses to this, as proven by their
worship and glorification). (Allaah is always) Maintaining
(His creation) with justice (wisdom and sound judgement).

There is no Ilaah but Him The Mighty, The Wise." {Surah
Aal Imraan, verse 18}

And then The Seal of all Ambiyaa ρ was most
knowledgeable about the Kalimah of Towheed. Allaah
Ta`ala says:

Know well that none is worthy of worship but Allaah and
seek forgiveness for your shortcomings and for the
Mu'mineen men and women. {Surah Muhammad ρ, verse 19}

And then Allaah Ta`ala mentions the word “Anna” (Surely
/ Indeed l without doubt) , which He had revealed to all His
Ambiyaa. This is the word of certainty.
He says:

We sent revelation to every Rasool before you (O

Muhammad ε , telling them) that, “Without doubt there is
no Ilaah but Me, so worship Me only.” {Surah Ambiyaa, verse 25}

Hence, Towheed, was the Deen of all the Ambiyaa, and it
was the way of the predecessors and the latter generations,
from amongst the truthful and pious ones, may Allaah
Ta`ala’s peace and salutations be upon all of them.

2). Holding on firmly to the words of Allaah Ta`ala:
"My ability is only from Allaah. Only on Him do I rely
and only to Him do I turn." {Surah Hood, verse 88}

3). As Allaah Taala says: **_"He is Pure, and He is Allaah, the One, the Omnipotent."_** {Surah Zumar, verse 4} And as Allaah Taala says: "Our Ilaah and your Ilaah is
One and (therefore) we surrender (Only) to Him (to His
commands) ." {Surah Ankaboot, verse 46}

This is for certainty (that Allaah is One), however, as a
negation (of any other deity), Allaah Ta`ala mentions: If
there were other Aaliha besides Allaah in the heavens
and the earth, the (system of the) two would be in chaos."
{Surah Ambiyaa, verse 22}

An image of this chaos is mentioned in the Aayat: If there
were (others sharing power with Him) , then every Ilaah
would have separated his creation (so that only he should
have control over them) and some would overpower the
others (in the fight for supremacy. This would have
resulted in the system of the universe being reduced to
chaos. However, since the universe is functioning
smoothly, it follows that such a scenario did not occur).
Allaah is Pure of the partners that they ascribe to Him
(Only He is in control and worthy of worship). {Surah
Mu'minoon, verse 91}

An image of the helplessness of the partners to divine
actions, is given in the Aayat: "It is Allaah Who has
created you, then sustains you, will then give you death
and again give you life (on the Day of Qiyaamah). Are
there any of your partners (gods) who can do any of this?
Allaah is Pure and Exalted above the partners they (the
Mushrikeen) ascribe to Him (because none can do what
He can do) ." {Surah Room, verse 40}

The negation of many (deities) is the confirmation of One
(Allaah). All the Aayaat that negate Shirk (polytheism), are
proofs for the confirmation of Oneness.

“He does not have any partners^1 , there is nothing like^2
Him, and there is nothing that can overwhelm^3 Him”

“He does not have any partners^1 ,
1). Allaah Ta`ala says: "Say (O Muhammad ρ !) , 'Truly
my salaah, all my acts of worship, my life and my death
are for Allaah, the Rabb of the universe.He (Allaah) has
no partner. With this (Towheed) have I been commanded
(to adhere to) and I am the first of the Muslims." {Surah
An'aam, verses 162,163 }

As Allaah Ta`ala mentions regarding Yusuf υυυυ, (when he
said): "It is not (correct) for us to ascribe any partners to
Allaah" {Surah Yusuf, verse 38}, and then he said: "Are numerous
gods better or Allaah, Who is The One and The
Almighty? " {Surah Yusuf, verse 39}, and then He said: Decisions
rest only with Allaah. He has commanded that only He be
worshipped. This is the right Deen, but most people (the
Kuffaar) do not know it " {Surah Yusuf, verse 40}. Allaah Taala says, ordering Nabi ρ: **_Say, “All praise is for Allaah, Who has not taken a child_** _(has neither sons nor daughters)_ **_, has no partner in kingdom and is not so weak that He requires an assistant. Declare His greatness in abundance."_** {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 111} **_there is nothing like_**^2 **_Him,_** 2). As Allaah Taala says: "There is nothing like Him
(nothing can compare with His Being or His qualities) and
He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing {Surah Shura, verse 11}.
That is, there is neither comparison to Him in so far as
being is concerned, nor as far as quality, nor action, nor
rank, nor status.

and there is nothing that can overwhelm^3 Him”
3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah is not such that
anything in the heavens and the earth can defeat him (He
is Capable of destroying people regardless of their power
and might). He is the All Knowing, Powerful." {Surah Faatir,
verse 44}

Helplessness exists either because of weakness or
deficiency in the ability of the doer, or due to a non-
existence of knowledge or a deficiency in knowledge.
Therefore, Allaah Ta`ala negates the first possibility with
His words of “Qadeer” (All-Powerful) , and then He
negates the second possibility with the word “Aleem” (All-
Knowing).

Also in other instances He negates both these weaknesses
from His Magnanimous Being by disproving each one of
them. He says in negating the first: “And indeed Allaah,
He is The Sustainer, The One with Absolute Power.”
Hence Allaah Taala confirms His Power and Absolute Might, thereby unequivocally negating any weakness. In negating the second, Allaah Taala says: “And indeed
Allaah encompasses everything with His Knowledge.”
After He has fully encompassed everything, there is
absolutely no possibility and room for ignorance from any
angle. And where these two (ignorance and helplessness)
are negated, then weakness is also negated, and power and
might remain on their own. Nothing more can be said
beyond that. It is therefore fully established that indeed
Allaah Ta`ala does whatever He desires, nothing in the
heavens and earth can overwhelm Him. None can prevent
His actions or avert His Commands.

“There is no deity^1 other than Him. He is Eternal^2
without a beginning and enduring^3 without end. He will
never perish^4 or come to an end.”

“There is no deity^1 other than Him.
1). As Allaah Ta`ala mentions on the tongues of Hadhrat
Nooh υ, Hood υ, Saalih υ and Shu'ayb υ: "Worship only

Allaah. There is no Ilaah for you but Him." {Surah A'raaf, verses
59,65.73.85 }

He is Eternal^2
2). As Allaah Taala says: **_“He is The First”_** {Surah Hadeed, verse 3}_._ The Quraan emphasises it and to be first is
absolute, in that it has no limit beyond it in beginning.
There is no beginning. The word “Qadeem” is used to
describe this (something which has no beginning).
However, Allaah Ta`ala uses the word “Awwal” , this is
better than using Qadeem because it ( Awwal ) does not
denote what comes after it to be similar to it or that it
follows it. For Him are the Beautiful Names.

without a beginning and enduring^3 without end.
3). As Allaah Taala says: **_“He is The Last”_** {Surah Hadeed, verse 3}. The Quraan specifies and confirms this. To be the
last is specific in that it is something, which has no limit in
ending. It is something, which is everlasting. The Arabic
word ‘Daa`im’ (continuous) is used to specify this
condition. This demonstrates the continuity of His
existence. Thus He is ‘Qadeem’ - Always was and will
always remain.

He will never perish^4 or come to an end.”
4). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Everything on earth shall
perish (on the Day of Qiyaamah if not sooner). (When this
happens,) Only the countenance of your Rabb the
Possessor of majesty and benevolence shall remain
(forever, without ever perishing) ." {Surah Rahmaan, verses 26.27 }

In another Aayat, Allaah Υ says: "Everything shall perish
but His Countenance." {Surah Qasas, verse 88}

Indeed, existence is the essence of His Being. These
(existence and Allaah’s Being) are necessary corollaries.
Thus He is always existent. Never was He non-existent. It
is not possible that (the quality) of existence be separated
from Him and that non-existence be associated with Him.
His existence is always necessary. His eradication is
impossible.

“Nothing happens^1 except what He wills. No
imagination can conceive^2 of Him and no understanding
can comprehend^3 Him.”

1). As Allaah Ta`ala says regarding Hadhrat Nooh υ:
“My advice to you shall not benefit you if I intend to
advise you while Allaah intends to send you astray
(allows you to stray). {Surah 11, verse 34}

That is, what Allaah Wills will come to pass, and not what
they (people) desire.

As Allaah Ta`ala says:
Say, “Who can defend you against Allaah if He intends
evil or good for you? Besides Allaah, they (the Kuffaar
and Munaafiqeen) will not find any protecting friend, nor
any helper.'" {Surah Ahzaab, verse 17}

2). That is, the power of imagination cannot fathom or
comprehend Him; meaning that the natural comprehension
of imagination and thought, etc. cannot fathom Allaah
Ta`ala because they do not supercede (go beyond) the body
and natural senses. To such an extent that they cannot
reach the delicate blessed celestial forms, either.

It is for this reason that Nabi ρ said regarding the blessings
of Jannah that they are things which no eye had seen, no
ear has heard or no human heart can perceive. This is
notwithstanding the fact that Jannah is from amongst the
realms of physical form in the celestial world. Hence
when these thoughts and imaginations cannot discern the
blessed physical forms of the unseen, then how can it ever
reach or comprehend Al-Lateeful Khabeer (Most Kind All
Knowing)?

Noor (in general) is devoid of physical or spiritual form.
Allaah Taala has created both of them and He has created their inherent qualities as well. This Hadith (cited above) is proof that the imagination and thoughts of man cannot fathom or comprehend the unseen, especially the Being of Allaah Taala, Who is The Unseen.

3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: They are unable to
encompass (comprehend) His knowledge." {Surah TaaHaa, verse
110}

It is mentioned in the Sihaah: “I thought of a thing and
imagined it, and when I understood a thing, then I knew
it.”

Thus Allaah Ta`ala has negated His being comprehended
by the knowledge of the creation. Thus if His
comprehension by the creation is not possible with their
knowledge, what do you say about their comprehension of
Him by their imaginations? Indeed it is not logically
possible for the creation to comprehend their Creator,
neither with their sight, nor knowledge nor imagination,
because indeed, complete comprehension with all things
and from all sides, angles, qualities, traits, effects, actions,
etc. are from amongst the Qualities of Divinity. There is

no interference here by the intelligence of the servant. As
Allaah Taala says: **_Allaah surrounds_** _(has knowledge of and is in control of)_ **_everything."_** {Surah 4, verse 126} Allaah Taala mentions in another Aayat: "Allaah surrounds
them from all over" {Surah 85, verse 20}

In conclusion, even the power of intellect (of man), that is
besides their power of thought and imagination, does not
have the ability to comprehend Allaah Ta`ala.

“He is different^1 from any created being. He is Living
and never dies^2 and is eternally active^3 and never
sleeps.”

“He is different^1 from any created being.
1). As Allaah Taala says: **_"There is nothing like Him_** _(nothing can compare with His Being or His qualities)_ **_and He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing_** {Surah Shura, verse 11}_._ This is the negation in general of any being, quality and action, (being similar to Allaah Taala). Explanation on
this has passed. His Being is not like our beings. His
Qualities are unlike our qualities. Similar are all other
attributes and things. He knows every unclear and vague
thing, unlike us. His power is unlike ours. He Sees, not
like our seeing. He Hears, not like our hearing. Similarly,
he Ascends, not like our ascending and He Descends, not
like our descending. He Smiles not like our laughter. He
Establishes Himself on His Throne, not like our sitting on
our thrones (chairs). Because, indeed He is not like us.
There is no similarity to Allaah, nor any equal. Indeed
Allaah Ta`ala is THE Perfect Example. He is The Mighty,
The All-Wise.

He is Living and never dies^2
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Rely only on The Living
(Allaah) , Who cannot die and glorify His praises." {Surah
Furqaan, verse 58}

and is eternally active^3 and never sleeps.”
3). As Allaah Taala says: **_Allaah_** _(is such that)_ **_besides Him there is no Ilaah, He is Ever Living, The Maintainer_** _(of everything)_**_. Neither drowsiness nor sleep overcomes Him."_** {Surah Baqara, verse 255} Since drowsiness and sleep are similar to death, in fact they are sisters, according to the words of the Hadith. They are hindrances and obstacles to life. Complete and perfect life cannot exist with these deficiencies. Perfect Life is the basis of being eternally active. Allaah Taala has negated
for Himself the attribute of slumber and sleep. This
negation comes after the words “Ever Living, the One Who
sustains”. This is proof of His Perfect Life and perfection
in being eternally active.

“He creates^1 without His being in need^2 to do so and
provides^3 for His creation without any effort.”
“He creates^1
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah is the Creator of
everything." {Surah Zumar, verse 62}

Thus the Creator is Allaah Alone, and none else, because,
indeed the quality of creating is unique to Allaah. It is not
possible for the creation to create anything. The creation
has itself been granted its existence (i.e. it is itself a created
being), and this was not possible except by One who was
already in existence, by Himself. The creation did not
come into existence by itself, so how can it bring

something else into existence? As Allaah Taala says, after expounding on the creation of the heavens and the earth and everything else: **_"This is Allaah’s creation, so show me what those_** _(gods that you Kuffaar worship)_ **_besides Him have created!"_** {Surah Luqmaan, verse 11} Allaah Taala says
in another Aayat: "It is Allaah Who has created you, then
sustains you, will then give you death and again give you
life (on the Day of Qiyaamah). Are there any of your
partners (gods) who can do any of this? Allaah is Pure
and Exalted above the partners they (the Mushrikeen)
ascribe to Him (because none can do what He can do) ."
{Surah Room, verse 40}

without His being in need^2
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "I have created man and Jinn
only to worship Me. I require neither sustenance from
them nor do I want them to feed Me. (Rather) Without
doubt, Allaah is the Sustainer (He provides people with
their sustenance) , the Possessor of absolute power,
Strong." {Surah Dhaariyaat, verse 56-58}

The negation of the need for food is the negation of needs.
Nevertheless, Ibaadat (worship) is the object of (the)
creation, according to the Quraan Shareef. This (purpose of creation) was for (the benefit of) The Creator, and not for the creation (i.e. the creation was not created for their own benefit but to worship their Creator). As Allaah Taala
says: "O people! You are all beggars before Allaah
(dependant on Him for everything) and (Only) Allaah is
Independent (not in need of anyone or anything) , Most
Worthy of praise" {Surah Faatir, verse 15}.

Since Allaah Υ is the Absolute Self-Sufficient One and the
creation is in need of Him, for their creation and existence,

it is not possible for the Absolutely Self-Sufficient to be in
need of the needy.

to do so and provides^3 for His creation without any
effort.”
3). As Allaah Taala says: **_"Without doubt, Allaah is the Sustainer (He provides people with their sustenance), the Possessor of absolute power, Strong."_** {Surah Dhaariyaat, verse 58} By Allaah Taala saying that He is the “ the
Possessor of absolute power, Strong ”, He is indicating
that to sustain (the creation) is easy for Him. There is no
difficulty or inconvenience in it for Him. Difficulty and
inconvenience are indicative of weakness, and He is pure
from all weaknesses. Allaah Ta`ala says: “ the Possessor
of absolute power, Strong. ”. In another Aayat, He says:
"Say, 'Should I take as a helper anyone else besides
Allaah Who has created the heavens and the earth and
Who feeds (all His creation) without Himself being fed
(all need Him while He needs none) ?” {Surah An'aam, verse 14}

Allaah Ta`ala is indicating by the words “ Who has created
the heavens and the earth ” , at His Absolute and Complete
Power. There is absolutely no possibility or sign of
weakness in Him. And when He has no weakness, then
there is absolutely no exhaustion or difficulty for Him in
sustaining and providing (for His creation).

“He causes death^1 with no fear and restores to life^2
without difficulty.”

“He causes death^1 with no fear
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says regarding the nation of Saalih
υ when they were destroyed and annihilated: "So their
Rabb annihilated them because of their sins and made

their destruction widespread. Allaah does not fear the
consequences." {Surah Shams, verse 14,15}

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "To Him belongs the kingdom of
the heavens and the earth, He gives life and death and
has power over all things." {Surah Hadeed, verse 2}

Indeed full and total power over everything is the proof of
not having any fear of anything, which may be alive or
dead. Fear stems from helplessness, which is negatory of
full and total power and encompassment. If Allaah Taala did not have the control over life and death and if these two were in the control of someone else, then He would feared (Nauthubillaah) this other being when removing life from a soul, because it may be that He is causing harm and opposing (this other being). Therefore the control of these two (life and death) are not in the control of any other being. As Allaah Taala says: "They do not have any
power over life, death or resurrection." {Surah Furqaan, verse 3}.
In fact, these two are entirely in His Control Alone,
because He is the One Who had created them. As He says:
“He has created death and life.” {Surah Mulk, verse 2}. In fact,
He is also the Only One Who has the Knowledge of these
two things, not anyone else. As He says: "Indeed it is only
We who give life and death and to Us shall be the
return." {Surah Qaaf, verse 43}

Whom should He fear when taking life?
What is the reason for Allaah Taala, Most Mighty, to fear? The possibility of Allaah Taala having fear is Baatil
(spurious), in fact it is nonsensical. The author has attested
to this by stating: “He causes death with no fear...” Hence
we can safely and assuredly say that indeed Allaah Ta`ala
causes death without any fear and He gives life without
any crave.

and restores to life^2 without difficulty.”
2). “Al-Baath” (resurrection), it refers to the life after death, which will be granted on the Day of Qiyaamah. As Allaah Taala says: "Qiyaamah is about to happen
without any doubt and because Allaah will surely raise
those who are (lying) in their graves." {Surah Hajj, verse 7}

Allaah Ta`ala says in another Aayat: They (the Kuffaar)
say, “This is merely our worldly life (to enjoy) and we will
not be raised (resurrected on the Day of Qiyaamah) .” If
only you could see (the time) when they will be made to
stand before their Rabb. He will say, “Is this
(resurrection) not the truth?” (Expecting mercy,) They
will reply, “Indeed, by our Rabb!” He will tell them,
“Taste the punishment because you committed kufr (in
the world) .” {Surah An'aam, verse 29,30}

With regard to there being no difficulty in resurrection,
Allaah Ta`ala says: The Kuffaar think that they will never
be resurrected. Tell them, “Definitely by the oath of my
Rabb! You will certainly be resurrected and then you will
be informed of what you did. This is very simple for
Allaah.” {Surah Taghaabun, verse 7}

That is, there is absolutely no difficulty for Allaah Ta`ala
in resurrecting the creation.

Allaah Ta`ala says: (O mankind! To Allaah) Your creation
and resurrection is like (is as simple as creating and
resurrecting) a single soul (because either task requires
absolutely no effort from Allaah). Without doubt Allaah is
All Hearing, All Seeing (just as Allaah sees and hears
everything at the same time, He can resurrect all of
creation at the same time) ." {Surah Luqmaan, verse 28}

That is the annihilation of the entire universe by Allaah
Taala is like the annihilation of one soul (i.e. so insignificant and simple). The reason for the ease in resurrection lies in His not being dependant upon anything, and in His absolute Power over everything. The existence of Allaah Taala is complete and so are His Qualities. This
necessitates that He is absolutely independent of
everything else when effecting any change or movement.
This makes it obvious that for Allaah Taala to grant life is extremely simple and easy, owing to His perfection and His Absolute Power. As Allaah Taala says: "This
(creation of man and reviving of dead earth) all happens
because Allaah is True (without Whom none of this can
take place) , because He (Alone) gives life to the dead, and
because only He has power over all things..." {Surah Hajj,
verse 6}

Since His Absolute and All-Encompassing Power negates
weakness and helplessness, difficulty is also negated.

Another reason for the ease in resurrection is that it is
merely a repeat (of life given the first time). As Allaah
Ta`ala says: "As We originated the first creation, We
shall repeat it" {Surah Ambiyaa, verse 104}.

Logically, also, to repeat something is much simpler than
doing it for the first time. Hence, for that Being upon
whom the initial creation was a simple and untiring matter,
the repeat of the same will also be executed without any
difficulty. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "It is He Who
originated creation and will repeat (the act of creation) ,
which (judging in terms of human experience) will be
easier for Him (because people generally find it easier to
do something they have done before) ." {Surah Room, verse 27}

***********************************************
********
“He has always existed^1 together with His Attributes...”
1). As Allaah Taala says: **_He is Allaah, there is no Ilaah but He. He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful."_** {Surah Hashar, verse 22} The meaning of the word “Allaah” which appears in the Quraan, is that Being in Whom is combined all the
excellent and perfect Qualities, which are known as the
“Asmaa-ul-Husna”. In Quraanic terminology, the word “Allaah” denotes to His Complete Being with all His Qualities, and not a being which is void of any qualities. It is a necessary corollary (in the belief in Allaah Taala) that
His Qualities are not created. It is not possible for any
Quality to be absent from the Being of Allaah Taala at any point in time. Since Allaah Taala Himself was always
existent, and this is unanimously accepted throughout the
ages and nations, it follows that His Qualities were also
always existent, and are an integral part of His Being. It is
part of His Being and cannot be separated. This Aayat
proves that indeed Allaah Ta`ala’s Being was always
existent with His Qualities. Just like He was existent since
time immemorial so too were His Qualities.

“Since before^1 His creation. Bringing creation into
existence did not add anything to His Attributes that was
not already there. As He was, together with His
Attributes, in pre-eternity, so He will remain throughout
endless time.”

1). That is, Allaah Taala was with these Perfect Qualities before He created the creation. None of His (already existent, perfect) Qualities were added to or increased after He created the creation or owing to the creation. Similarly, none of these Qualities will decrease after the creation is annihilated, or due to its annihilation. He always was there with His Qualities and will remain forever with His Qualities, prior to the creation and even after their annihilation. As Allaah Taala says: " Allaah is
the Creator of everything, and He is the Administrator of
all things. The keys (control) of the heavens and the
earth belong to him. Those who disbelieve in Allaah’s
Aayaat are the real losers." {Surah Zumar, verses 62,63}

When He created the creation, He was Allaah, Alone. This
is the claim of the Quraan. Naturally, the Creator comes before the creation, otherwise nothing would be found, if it were not created before. If you were to find them without having been created, then it would be necessary to accept that they were uncreated, and that they are independent of being created. This is impossible and contrary to the obvious. This confirms that it is necessary for the Creator to have been there before the creation. And since He was always existent, He was so with all His Qualities, since they are inherent with His Being, and are not able to be separated from Him. Therefore, it is confirmed that indeed Allaah Taala’s Qualities always were existent in Him, just
as He was always existent. Also, for these Qualities to be
separated from Him or for Him to be free of them is
impossible. Similarly, it is more impossible to accept that
new Qualities are created in Allaah Ta`ala as time goes on.
Hence, He is the Creator before the creation (came into
existence) and He is the Creator after the creation (is
annihilated). When we say that He was the Creator before
the creation, it means that He was able to create and He

had this Power and Knowledge. He brought the creation
into existence when He so desired and Willed. Just as the
Quality of creation was always with Him, so too were all
His other Perfect Qualities. All His Qualities were always
there in His Being, regardless of whether they were made
apparent or not. He was (is and will be) able to show what
He wanted of His Qualities when He desired. He does
whatever He Wills. He protects when He pleases, He
nourishes when He wants. He gives life to whom He
pleases and gives death also to who and when He pleases.
Just like a writer, at the time of writing, is regarded as a
writer by his action (of physically writing). His quality of
being a writer will not be removed from Him when He is
not in the act of writing, because He is a writer by his mere
ability. That is, the quality of writing is an integral part of
His being. He will act according to it, when and how He
desires.

“It was not^1 only after the act of creation that He could
be described as ‘The Creator’ nor was it only by the act of
origination that He could be described as ‘The
Originator’. He was always the Rabb, even when there
was nothing to be Rabb of, and always the Creator, even
when there was no creation. In the same way that He is
the ‘Bringer to life of the dead’, after He has brought
them to life a first time, and deserves this name before
bringing them to life, so too, He deserves the name of
‘Creator’ before He had created them. This is because He
has the Power to do everything, everything is dependent
on Him, everything is easy for Him, and He does not
need anything. ‘There is nothing like Him and He is The
Hearer, The Seer’.”

1). Indeed the Quraan Shareef attributes these Qualities to His Pure Being, whilst using the past tense. Also, all the pure and perfect qualities are attributed to His Great Names, when it says: **_“And Allaah is Aware of all things”, “And Allaah encompasses all things”, “And Allaah has power over that”, “And Allaah has power over all things”, “And Allaah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing”, “And Allaah is Independent and worthy of all Praise”_** – The use of the word _“kaana”_ in these sentences indicates that all these qualities existed in Allaah Taala from before and
are still existent. They are all inherent in His Being. This
proves that His Being was always existent. They also
indicate towards this fact that His Knowledge was always
existent, with His Being and it is present in His Name. It
was there before He created the creation. Its existence was
unaffected by the creation. When it is established that the
enactment of these Qualities remained unchanged and
unaffected by the creation, they were before as they are
now and will always remain so. Similarly, the Names of
these Qualities always were and will always remain the
same. They are not merely names that exist at the time of
enactment. They are inherent Qualities to His Being. As
Allaah Ta`ala mentions: " He is Allaah, the Creator, the
Perfect Maker, the Fashioner Who has the most beautiful
names. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies
Him. He is the Mighty (with absolute power) , the Wise
(with absolute knowledge and wisdom) ." {Surah Hashar, verse 24}

These Qualities are mentioned with a few others in this
Aayat and they are neither restricted to place, time nor
tense. The clear indication is that He was Creator, Inventor
and Bestower, before He created the creation and always
before that. Also, that He had these Qualities after He
created the creation until forever.

We have therefore established that Allaah Ta`ala was
always with His Qualities and will always remain with
them. Just as we would not call a writer, a writer, only
when he does the act of writing, but the title of ‘writer’ will
be given to a person who had the quality of writing even
before he actually does some writing and after he writes.

“He created^1 creation with His Knowledge. He appointed
destinies^2 for those He created. He allotted^3 to them
fixed life spans.”

“He created^1 creation with His Knowledge.
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: “Does the One Who created
(you and your actions) not know " {Surah Mulk, verse 14}.
Logically and rationally, we accept that it is the Creator of
everything that has bestowed the creation with knowledge
and perfection, because He is the One Who has created
everything. He is the One Who has started the creation and
laid down for it, its guidelines. As He says: “Our Rabb is
He Who granted each thing its (appropriate) form and
then guided it (showed it what it ought to be doing and
how to live) .” {Surah Taahaa, verse 20} It is not possible for the
Creator of perfection to be free of it, in fact He is most
worthy of it and He is the One Who had it first. It is
necessary for the Creator to have full knowledge of His
creation, even before it was created. If this was not the
case, then how would He have laid things down (created it)
if He was ignorant, Nauthubillaah!

He appointed destinies^2 for those He created.
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: He (Allaah) has created
everything, and then meticulously perfected them." {Surah

Furqaan, verse 2}. Allaah Ta`ala says in another Aayat: “We
have certainly created everything by (finely calculated)
measure (so that everything meets the requirements for its
task and so that everything happens when it is destined to
happen)." {Surah Qamar, verse 49}

In another Aayat, Allaah Ta`ala states: "We have with Us
the treasures of all things (rain, mineral wealth, food,
spiritual guidance, etc) and We send them down only in
stipulated quantities (as the need arises, according to
Allaah’s wisdom)" {Surah Hijr, verse 21}.

He allotted^3 to them fixed life spans.”
3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: Allaah has created the
heavens and the earth with the truth (for good reason)
and for an appointed term (Have they not deduced that
just as everything else in this world comes to an end, so too
will the universe come to an end on the Day of Qiyaamah,
when everyone will be required to face Allaah?).
(However,) Many people reject their meeting with their
Rabb (even though their very logic demands that a time
must come when wrong-doers have to be taken to task and
good-doers have to be rewarded) ." {Surah Room, verse 8}

The appointed term of a thing is its lifespan (age). The age
of everything is specified. As Allaah Taala says: _“ all that is between them”_ , i.e. the age of everything between the heavens and the earth is specified and set out. The completion (of a things life-span) is death. Hence, everything, that is between the heavens and the earth has been specified with a limit to its life-span. Everything will expire at the end of its specified time. The Quraan has
mentioned the expiry of many things that exist in the
universe, like the jinn, man, stars, etc.

***********************************************

“Nothing about them was hidden^1 from Him before He
created them, and He knew^2 everything that they would
do before He created them. He ordered^3 them to obey
Him and forbade them to disobey Him. Everything^4
happens according to His decree and Will, and His Will
is accomplished.”
“Nothing about them was hidden^1 from Him before He
created them,
1). The commentary of this is as was explained by the
author !ا $%&ر in the previous commentary of “He created
creation with His knowledge” , and the Aayat: “Does the
One Who created (you and your actions) not know " {Surah
Mulk, verse 14}

and He knew^2 everything that they would do before He
created them.
2). Two things are derived from the Aayaat; one is that
the Creator of the creation is Allaah Ta`ala, as He says:
“And Allaah has created you and whatever you do” {Surah
Saaffaat, verse 96}. Second is that the Creator of things, Knows
about them, as He says; “Does the One Who created (you
and your actions) not know " {Surah Mulk, verse 14}

Hence, it is established from the combination of these two
Aayaat, that indeed Allaah Ta`ala is knowledgeable of the
actions of the creation even before they were created. This
is so because it is He Who has laid down for them
whatever actions they execute. Then how is it possible for
the One Who has laid down their (creation’s) actions, and
then He is not aware of what He has laid down?

He ordered^3 them to obey Him and forbade them to
disobey Him.
3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Verily Allaah instructs
(people to carry out) justice, Ihsaan (do things well, as
well as doing everything with the consciousness that
Allaah is watching) , and giving (charity) to relatives. And
Allaah forbids immoral behaviour, evil and oppression.
He advises you so that you may take heed (and thereby
save ourselves from ruin and Jahannam) ." {Surah Nahl, verse 90}

The Quraan Shareef is replete with Commands and Prohibitions. The author, by stating: _“He ordered them to obey Him”,_ indicates towards the fact that mankind is restrained by the Shari'ah, with his intelligence, understanding and choice. Man is not inanimate, that he has no intelligence, or Shari'ah, or guide. He was not created in vain. He was neither left useless, nor in futility nor in vain. He was created to obey his Creator and to worship Him. It is necessary for the creation to act in accordance to the pleasures of His Rabb. He should not traverse the path (of life) except by abiding to the Commands of Allaah Taala and abstaining from whatever
he has been prohibited from. He has been ordered to obey
Allaah Ta`ala and has been ordained to abstain from the
prohibitions.

Everything^4 happens according to His decree and Will,
and His Will is accomplished.”
4). Allaah Ta`ala has stated regarding the wind: " We
placed the wind at his service, which would blow gently
by his command (transporting him) wherever he wished to
go." {Surah Saad, verse 36}

Allaah Ta`ala states regarding the sun: "The sun travels
towards its destination (within its orbit without straying

from its course). This is the arrangement of the Mighty,
the All Knowing." {Surah Yaaseen, verse 38}

Allaah Taala states regarding the ships: **_"...including the ships that navigate the oceans by His command?"_** {Surah Hajj, verse 65}. Such examples are plentiful in the Quraan-e-
Kareem.

“The only will that people have is what He Wills^1 for
them. What He Wills for occurs and what He does not
Will, does not occur. He gives guidance^2 to whoever He
Wills, and protects them, and keeps them safe from harm,
out of His Generosity^3 and He leads astray whoever he
Wills, and abases them, and afflicts them, out of His
Justice^4 .”

“The only will that people have is what He Wills^1 for
them. What He Wills for occurs and what He does not
Will, does not occur.
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "You cannot will anything
without Allaah’s will" {Surah Insaan, verse 30}
How true is the following saying:

“Whatever You have not desired, will occur, even if I did
not desire so
And whatever I desire, if You have not desired it, it will not
occur.”

He gives guidance^2 to whoever He Wills, and protects
them, and keeps them safe from harm,
2). As Allaah Taala says: **_" Allaah sends astray whom He wills and He shall place whom He wills on the straight path_** _(Islaam)_ **_."_** {Surah An'aam, verse 39} As Allaah Taala mentions that Hadhrat Moosa υ said:
This is but a test from You by means of which You send
astray whoever You please and guide whoever You
please." {Surah A'raaf, verse 155}

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Whoever Allaah wishes to guide,
He expands his bosom for Islaam (by placing the light of
Imaan into it). (On the other hand,) Whoever He desires to
send astray, He narrows and constricts his bosom (by
means of wayward ideas so that it cannot accept
Imaan) ..." {Surah An'aam, verse125 }

These texts point to this fact that whatever Allaah Wills
will take place and whatever He does not Will does not
take place. How can something occur in His Domain that
He does not Desire?

Guidance, deviation, honour and disgrace, all of this is
subjected to the Will of Allaah Ta`ala.

out of His Generosity^3 and
3). Generosity, is granted to the deserving servant. And
Allaah Taala showers blessings upon him as He warrants it. Allaah Taala’s Generosity is a benefaction upon His
servants. His protection for the servant is to safeguard him
from any harm.

He leads astray whoever he Wills, and abases them, and
afflicts them, out of His Justice^4 .”
4). Adl (Allaah Taala Justice) upon His slaves is the retribution and compensation (for their actions) without any excesses or oppression. The servant of Allaah Taala is

given his just rewards for his (evil) actions, without any
excessiveness or harm. Hence Adl is the equal retribution
of that which is by Allaah Ta`ala without excessiveness or
holding back.

Therefore, Allaah Taala’s blessings are from His Generosity and punishments and hardships are from His Adl. As Allaah Taala says: "(O mankind!) The
misfortunes that afflict you are a result of the (evil)
actions you earn, and (because of your many sins, you
deserve to suffer even more adversities, but) Allaah
pardons a great deal (of your sins, because of which you
are spared many more hardships) ." {Surah Shura, verse 30}

Hence the affliction of punishment is in proportion to the
doings of man. This is an indication of His Adl. His
Forgiveness, even though one is not deserving thereof, is a
sign of His Generosity. As Allaah Taala says: **_"Whatever good comes to you is from Allaah and whatever misfortune befalls you is from yourselves_** _(because of the evil that you do)_ **_"_** {Surah Nisaa, verse 76}. The bestowment of goodness and blessings is reward multiplied. It is granted by Allaah Taala upon whomsoever He wishes. The
affliction of punishment and difficulties is from the Adl of
Allaah Taala, which is in lieu for the (evil) actions of man. All of man are at the beck and call of the desire of Allaah Taala and are suspended between His Mercy and Adl.

“All of them are subject to His Will between either His
Generosity or His justice. No one can ward off^1 His
Decree”
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "If Allaah afflicts you with
(any) harm, none can remove it besides Him. (On the
contrary,) If He intends (any) good for you, then none
can prevent His grace (none can stop the good from
reaching you). He bestows His grace on those of His
bondsmen whom He pleases and He is the Most
Forgiving, the Most Merciful." {Surah Yunus, verse 107}

As Allaah Ta`ala says: There is none to withhold the
mercy Allaah opens to His people (such as rain,
sustenance, spiritual upliftment) , and there is none to
release the mercy that He withholds. He is the Mighty
(Able to do as He pleases without anyone to challenge
Him) , the Wise (knows exactly when and on whom to
shower His mercy) " {Surah Faatir, verse 2}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "Undoubtedly, if you ask them (the
Mushrikeen) who created the heavens and the earth, they
will certainly reply, “Allaah!” Say, “Tell me about those
whom you worship besides Allaah. If Allaah wishes that
any harm should afflict me, can they avert the harm? Or
if Allaah wishes to shower mercy upon me, are they able
to restrain His mercy?” Say, “Allaah is enough for me,
and only in Him should those who have trust place their
trust.” (Although the Mushrikeen worshipped many idols,
they acknowledged that it was Allaah Who created the
universe and Who had control over everything) {Surah Zumar,
verse 38}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "When Allaah intends evil
(misfortune) to befall a nation, there is none to turn it
away it. They (on whom the evil befalls) will have no
helper besides Allaah." {Surah Ra'ad, verse 11}

to be equal to Allaah Taala in any aspect. As Allaah Taala says: "So never make others equal (partners) to
Allaah (in worship) when you know (that they cannot
create as Allaah creates and therefore do not deserve to be
worshipped) " {Surah Baqara, verse 22}. As Allaah Ta`ala says:
“There is none equal to Him (neither in His Being nor in
His qualities) .” {Surah Ikhlaas, verse 4}

We believe^5 in all of this and are certain that everything
comes from Him.
5). Imaan means to recognise the Truth with certainty,
and with absolute submissiveness and true acceptance.
Yaqeen means the establishment (of Imaan) in one’s heart.
That is, we believe with absolute certainty in our hearts
and our firm belief is that there is no opposite or equal to
Allaah Taala. **_And we are certain that Muhammad_**^6 **_(sallallahu alaihi wasallam)”_** 6). Allaah Taala mentions regarding him in His Noble
Kitaab, by two praiseworthy names, i.e. Muhammad and
Ahmad. Allaah Ta`ala says, in the first instance: "As for
those who have Imaan, who do righteous deeds and who

believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad ε ..."
{Surah Muhammad ρ, verse 2}

Secondly, Allaah Ta`ala says from Hadhrat Isaa υ: "...and
(I am) giving (you) the good news of a Rasool to come
after me (among the Arabs) , whose name will be Ahmad

(referring to Rasulullaah ρ ) .” {Surah Saff, verse 6}
He ρ is the Divinely-sent epitome in this universe of
knowledge, appearance, beauty, status, honour and
perfection. He is unique amongst the creation and there is
none in the creation that is like him. Nabi ρ said: “The first
thing that Allaah Ta`ala created was my Noor and He
sealed (Nabuwwaat) with it.” Nabi ρ said: “The
Nabuwwaat was sealed with me.”

Hence he was the first of creation in being created and he
was seal of Ambiyaa. May Allaah Ta`ala’s choicest
blessings and peace be upon him.

“Is His chosen servant^1 and selected^2 Rasul”
“Is His chosen servant^1
1). He excels in the perfection of being Allaah Taala’s bondman, because indeed this perfection of his is of the highest stage and is the root of all perfection. Nabi ρ was the noblest specimen of perfection (amongst the creation). It is for this reason that Allaah Taala refers to him in the
dearest of terms, with the word “Abd” (slave), when
Allaah Ta`ala says : "Pure is that Being Who transported

His slave (Rasulullaah ρ ) by night" {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 1}.
Allaah Ta`ala says: When Allaah’s slave (Rasulullaah ρ )
stood up to supplicate to (worship) Him, they (the
Kuffaar) densely crowd around him (to intimidate him so
that he stops worshipping Allaah) ." {Surah Jinn, verse 19}

Allaah Ta`ala says: "Then (Allaah) sent that revelation to
His slave, which He revealed" {Surah Najm, verse 10}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "If you are in doubt about what We
have revealed to Our bondsman..." {Surah 2, verse 23}

Allaah Ta`ala says: "Blessed indeed is the Being Who
revealed the Decider (the Qur'aan, which differentiates
between right and wrong, Halaal and Haraam, etc) to His

bondsman (Rasulullaah ρ ) ..." {Surah Furqaan, verse 1}
It is due to all this that our Nabi ρ deserves the highest
stage in honour and status. He deserves the noblest
position amongst all the creation. He is the leader of all of
Bani Aadam (mankind). He was the chief and the leader of
all the Ambiyaa.

and selected^2 Rasul”
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: “...and who follow the

Rasool (who is also) the untutored Nabi (Muhammad ε ,
about) whom they find (his name and description) written
in the Torah and the Injeel (both of which they have) with
them. {Surah A'raaf, verse 157}

Allaah Ta`ala says, speaking to Nabi ρ: " O Nabi ρ! We
have certainly sent you as a witness (who will bear
testimony against the Kuffaar of all nations on the Day of
Qiyaamah) , a carrier of good news (to the Mu'mineen that
they will enjoy Jannah) , a warner." {Surah Ahzaab, verse 45}

“And His Messenger with whom He is well pleased^1. And
that he is the seal of all Ambiyaa^2 ”

“And His Messenger with whom He is well pleased^1.
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Muhammad ε is Allaah’s
Rasool" {Surah Fatah, verse 29}. In another Aayat, Allaah Ta`ala

says: "Muhammad εεεε is but a Rasool (of Allaah) " {Surah Aal
Imraan, verse 144}. In another Aayat Allaah Ta`ala says,

addressing Nabi ρ: "O Rasool ε! Propagate what
(everything that) has been revealed to you from your
Rabb" {Surah Maa'idah, verse 67}.

The words “Istafaa”, “Ijtabaa” and “Irtadhaa” are all
similar in meaning. The aim here is to explain the fact that
Nabi ρ was specially chosen as a Rasul and granted the

honour of conveying the Message. Indeed, Nabuwwaat is a
gift from Allaah Rabbul Izzat, it is not something that can
be earned by the servant of Allaah. As Allaah Taala says: **_"Allaah knows best where He wishes to place His message_** _(Allaah knows who qualifies to be His Rasool and where to send him)"_ {Surah An'aam, verse 124}. Allaah Taala says:
"Your Rabb creates whatever He wills and selects
(whoever He wills to be a Nabi and whatever injunctions
He deems appropriate for a nation) " {Surah Qasas, verse 68}.

And that he is the seal of all Ambiyaa^2 ”
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Muhammad εεεε is not the
father of any men among you, but he is Allaah’s Rasool
and the seal of all Ambiyaa (after whom there shall never
come another Nabi) " {Surah Ahzaab, verse 40}.

The numerous Ahaadith relating the Nabi ρ being the seal
of Ambiyaa have reached the rank of “Tawaatur” (i.e.
they are authentic to the highest degree). The Nabuwwaat
has been sealed with regard to the necessities of the Deen
and the foundations of it are perfected. This is corroborated
by the Quraanic text, when Allaah Taala says: "Today I
have perfected your Deen for you" {Surah Maa'idah, verse 3}.
That person who denies this fact or interprets it in any
other way becomes a kaafir, since interpretations in the
foundations of the Deen are of no consequence.

Know that all the perfections in man are subservient to the
perfections of Nabuwwaat and all the perfections of
Nabuwwaat are subservient to the Seal of Ambiyaa. He
that is the Seal, is the culmination of the perfections and
achievements of all the predecessors. In fact the
fountainhead of all mankind was Muhammad (sallallahu
alaihi wasallam). The text of the Qur`aan and the claim of
Nabi ρ bear testimony to the fact that he is in fact the seal

of all Ambiyaa. Nabi ρ said (part of a lengthy Hadith): “I
am the seal of all Ambiyaa” , Nabi ρ also said: “The
Nabuwwaat has been sealed with me.”

And he ρ, due to his being the Seal of all Nabuwwaat, was
perfect in all attributes (of man), to the highest degree, as
far as knowledge, actions, creation, status and honour is
concerned. However, as far as his knowledge is concerned
it surpassed the combined knowledge of all his
predecessors and followers. Nabi ρ said: “I was given the
knowledge of all the former and latter peoples.” As far as
his ρ verifying whatever is with the Ambiyaa, Allaah
Ta`ala says, addressing the Ambiyaa ا$#"م '()*+: "...when there

comes to you a Rasool (Muhammad ε ) confirming what is
with you..." {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 81}. To confirm whatever is
with the others is not possible except with the knowledge
that was bestowed upon them. As for his actions and
example (Sunnah), it is also the fountainhead of all the
excellent character of the former and latter generations. It
is for this reason that Allaah Taala has made this (the example and Sunnah of Nabi ρ) a means of salvation for all those who desire Allaah Taala and the Day of
Qiyaamah. Allaah Ta`ala says: "There is definitely an

excellent example in Allaah’s Rasool ρ for the one who
fears Allaah and the Last Day, and who remembers
Allaah abundantly" {Surah Ahzaab, verse 21}.

As for the character of Nabi ρ, it is also the culmination
and fountainhead of the best of all mankind. As Allaah

Ta`ala says: "Verily, you (O Rasulullaah ρ ) are (firmly
stationed) upon an exalted (flawless) character" {Surah Qalam,
verse 4}.

As for his ρ rank and status, Allaah Taala has extracted a covenant from all the Ambiyaa that they believe in him ρ - i.e. acknowledge his rank and status - and that they assist him. Allaah Taala says to them: "...then when there

comes to you a Rasool (Muhammad ε ) confirming what is
with you, you must believe in him and you must assist
him.” {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 81}.

Only those who are the followers of someone are ordered
to obey them, hence all the Ambiyaa are followers and
Ummatis of Nabi ρ. This chosen Ambiyaa is now a Nabi
unto them all. As Nabi ρ said: “I am the Nabi of the
Ambiyaa” (This has been reported by Imaam Suyooti- ,ا -./ر).
Hence, he ρ becomes the leader of all the Ambiyaa and
Messengers, because of his rank as being the seal of all
Ambiyaa ا$#"م '()*+.

“And the Imaam^1 of the Allaah-fearing”
1). Indeed he ρ was the Imaam of all the Ambiyaa ا$#"م '()*+,
hence he led all of them in Salaat on the night of Israa
(Me`raaj). And he who is the Imaam of the Ambiyaa is
most certainly and naturally the Imaam of all the pious and
Allaah-fearing, because there is none who can be more
Allaah-fearing than the Ambiyaa. Taqwa (to be Allaah-
fearing) is the basis and the traits of Nabuwwaat. Not the
opposite. As Nabi ρ said: “I take an oath in the name of
Allaah, indeed I am the most fearful of Allaah amongst you
and I am the most Allaah-fearing amongst you.” Hence, it
follows that the most Allaah-fearing of all those who fear
Allaah, is the leader of the Allaah-fearing.

***********************************************
********
“And the most honoured^1 of all the Messengers and the
beloved of the Rabb^2 of all the worlds.”
“And the most honoured^1 of all the Messengers
1). As Nabi ρ said: “I am (and will be) the leader of the
Bani Aadam on the Day of Qiyaamah, I am not saying it in
boast. In my hand will be the flag of Hamd (Praise), I am
not saying it in boast. There will not be on that day any
Ambiyaa, from Aadam and all besides him, except that they
will be below my flag.” The superiorship of Nabi ρ over
ALL the children of Hadhrat Aadam υ AND all the
Ambiyaa is borne out by the words “guide of the Bani
Aadam” , because the Ambiyaa are all the children of
Hadhrat Aadam υ. Nabi’s ρ leadership over Hadhrat
Aadam υ is borne out by the words “from Aadam and all
besides him, except that they will be under my flag”.

By Nabi ρ stating the Day of Qiyaamah, indicates to his
superiority over all people from the first to the last, in ALL
times. It is not such that his superior guideship is restricted
to one day over any other or one time over any other.

When the Sahaabah were discussing the Ambiyaa ا$#"م '()*+,
Nabi ρ said: “I have heard your speech and your surprise
that indeed Ibraheem is Khaleelullah (the friend of Allaah)
and he was like this and that; and that Moosa was
Najeeullaah (confidant) of Allaah and he was like this and
that; and that Isaa was Roohullaah (sign of Allaah) and he
was like this and that; and that Aadam was the chosen one
of Allaah and he was like this and that. KNOW! I am the

Habeebullah (beloved of Allaah), and I am not saying it in
boast.”

Also, the Quraan Majeed has explained the types of beloved one of Allaah and the reasons for His loving them. Allaah Taala says; “Indeed Allaah loves the Muhsineen
(those who do good)”. Allaah Taala says: _“Indeed Allaah loves the Tawwaabeen (those who repent) and he loves the Mutatahhireen (those who are pure).”_ Allaah Taala says:
“Indeed Allaah loves the Muttaqeen (those who are
Allaah-fearing).” Allaah Taala says: _“Indeed Allaah loves the Mutawakkileen (those who have trust in Him)”._ Allaah Taala says: “Indeed Allaah loves the Muqsiteen (those
who are just).” Allaah Taala says: _“Indeed Allaah loves the Saabireen (the patient ones).”_ Allaah Taala says:
“Indeed Allaah loves those who fight in His Path.”

Since all these qualities, of goodness, repentance, purity,
piety, trust, justice, patience, fighting in the Way of Allaah,
etc. to their perfection are incorporated in the Seal of
Ambiyaa ρ, indeed Muhammad ρ, is the most beloved to
Allaah Taala of all the creation. He is also the most honoured from amongst all of them, since all the beloved actions in the Sight of Allaah Taala are to be found in his
being, to perfection. He is The Beloved of Rabbul
Aalimeen. In fact, he is the head of all the beloveds of
Allaah Taala. Also, all these excellent qualities that can be found in the Ummat are sourced and spread from this perfected beloved of Allaah Taala, hence he can never be
bare of these qualities. In fact he is the origin of all of it (in
the Ummat). The origin is always stronger than the
offshoots. Naturally, Allaah Taala loves the origin more than He would the offshoots. Hence, _the_ beloved to Allaah Taala is the most beloved from all the other beloveds.

***********************************************
********
“Every claim to Nabuwwaat after him is falsehood^1 and
deceit.”
1). Because, after him there is indeed no other Nabi to

come. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Muhammad εεεε is not the
father of any men among you, but he is Allaah’s Rasool
and the seal of all Ambiyaa (after whom there shall never
come another Nabi) " {Surah Ahzaab, verse 40}. Nabi ρ said in a
lengthy Hadith: “Nabis and Rasools have been sealed with
me.” In another narration it is mentioned: “I am the (last)
brick and I am the seal of all the Ambiyaa.”

The Ahaadith reported with regard with this have reached
the stage of Tawaatur (continual chain). The one who lays
claim to Nubuwwat after the Seal of Ambiyaa, is a liar and
Dajjaal. Our Nabi ρ has informed us that in this Ummat
there will be thirty (30) Dajjaals. All of them will be great
liars and will lay claim to Nubuwwat, but there will be no
Nabi after him. Also, whoever stands up with the claim of
Nubuwwat of a previous Ummat, after The Seal of
Ambiyaa, is a liar, deceit and is not part of our Deen. This
is so because he did not bring faith in the Aayat of Khatm-
e-Nubuwwat. Any person who belies even one Aayat from
the Qur`aan Majeed is out of the pale of Islaam. A
necessary corollary of the Seal of Ambiyaa is that this
Deen overrides and abrogates all previous Shari'ahs and
religions. It is for this reason that Nabi ρ said: “If Moosa
was alive, he would have no option but to follow me.”
Hence, the one who lays claim to a Nabi of the past is
laying claim to an abrogated Shari'ah. It is not permissible
to follow it (previous Shari'ah). Therefore, his claim is

towards something which is impermissible, and not
towards a permitted act. What error and sin can be greater
than this?

“He is the one who has been sent to all^1 the jinn and all
mankind^2 with truth and guidance and with light and
illumination. The Qur`aan is the Word^3 of Allaah.”
“He is the one who has been sent to all^1
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says regarding the Jinn: “O our
people! Respond to (accept) Allaah’s caller (Rasulullaah

ρ ) and believe in him; (if you do so) Allaah will forgive
your sins and save you from a painful punishment.” {Surah
Ahqaaf, verse 31}

Allaah Ta`ala says from the Jinn: "Indeed we have heard
a most astounding Qur'aan. ‘It points towards
righteousness so we believed in it and we shall never
ascribe any partner to our Rabb.” {Surah Jinn, verses 1,2 }.

the jinn and all mankind^2 with truth and guidance and
with light and illumination.
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: 158. (O Muhammad ε !) Say,
“O people! Indeed to all of you (to the entire mankind
until the Day of Qiyaamah) I am the Rasool of that Allaah
to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the
earth" {Surah A'raaf, verse 158}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: We have sent you (O Muhammad

ε ) to the whole of mankind only as a carrier of good news
and a warner (and not as one who has to force people to
accept Imaan) {Surah Saba, verse 28}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Blessed indeed is the Being Who
revealed the Decider (the Qur'aan, which differentiates
between right and wrong, Halaal and Haraam, etc) to His

bondsman (Rasulullaah ρ ) so that he may be a warner to
the universe" {Surah Furqaan, verse 1}.

Nabi ρ said: “I have been honoured over all the other
Ambiyaa by virtue of six things; amongst them is that I
have been sent to the entire creation and the Nabuwwaat
has been sealed with me.”

**_The Quraan is the Word_**^3 **_of Allaah.”_** 3). The Sheikh ,ا -./ر intends by this statement that speech is a quality from amongst the Qualities of Allaah Taala. He
is a Speaker Who Speaks and the Quraan is the Speech of Allaah Taala. He Speaks through it. Hence, it is His
Speech in the form of His Words, and not only what He
has intended in meaning. Nevertheless, with regard to the
actual Speech of Allaah Taala, Allaah Taala says:

"Allaah specially (directly) spoke to Moosa υ " {Surah Nisaa,
verse 164}.

As far as Allaah Taala speaking through the Quraan, He
says: "These are the Aayaat of Allaah which We recite to

you (O Muhammad ε ) with truth (allowing you to have
the knowledge even though you were not present during
those times). You are certainly from among the
messengers (regardless of what the non-Muslims say) "
{Surah Baqara, verse 252}.
Recital is a type of speech. Hence, we are certain that
indeed Allaah Taala speaks through the Quraan and His
Signs. It is not that through these mediums He intends only
meaning. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "So when We have

recited it (the Qur'aan via Jibra’eel υ ) , follow its
recitation (only once the recitation has been completed) "
{Surah Qiyaamah, verse 18}.

Recital is connected to what is legible (written). It is not
except speech. Hence, the Quraan is the recitation of the written from Allaah Taala, except that we do not
comprehend the manner of Speech of Allaah Taala. Indeed His Speech is unlike our speech. Just like His Hearing in unlike ours. Indeed he is **_"There is nothing like Him_** _(nothing can compare with His Being or His qualities)_ **_and He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing"_** {Surah Shura, verse 11}. In fact, there is no scope in trying to fathom and comprehend any condition of the Being of Allaah Taala. Indeed, He is free from any condition (with regard
to His Qualities).

Allaah Taala says: " **_It is not_** _(suitable)_ **_for a human that Allaah speaks to him_** _(face-to-face)_ **_unless_** _(Allaah communicates with him)_ **_by means of inspiration..."_** {Surah Shura, verse 51}. It is ascertained from this that Allaah Taala
Speaks by way of Wahi. This is His Speech.

Another Aayat: "This Qur’aan has been revealed to me
so that I may warn you with it" {Surah An'aam, verse 19}. It is
established that the Quraan is Wahi (Divine Revelation). From both these Aayaat, it is established that Indeed the Quraan is the Speech of Allaah Ta`ala. Indeed He Speaks
(to us) through it.

“It came^1 from Him as speech without it being possible
to say how.”

1). That is, this Speech, the Quraan Majeed, originated and came from Allaah Taala’s Being, and not from
anyone else. The Mutazilas aver that Allaah Taala
created speech in a place other than from Himself, and then
this speech originated from that place. This averment is
spurious and the Quraan Majeed falsifies it. It associates this clear speech to the Being of Allaah Taala, in that it
originated from him and it was revealed from Him, not
from anyone else. As Allaah Ta`ala says: We have
revealed it (the Qur'aan) with the truth, and with the truth

did it come. We have sent you (O Muhammad ε ) only as a
carrier of good news (of Jannah for the Mu'mineen) and a
warner (to the Kuffaar that they will enter Jahannam) "
{Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 105}.

That is, this Quraan originated from Us, and it was revealed by Us, and not from another place or source, like from the Nabi, for example. Indeed he is only the giver of glad tidings and a warner through the medium of this Speech. He is not the maker of it. He was the recipient of revelation, and not the inventor/writer. He was favoured over the rest of the creation. As Allaah Taala says: It is a
revelation from the Wise, Who is Most Worthy of praise"
{Surah HaaMeem Sajdah, verse 42}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: This (Qur'aan) is a revealed book
from Allaah, the Mighty, the Wise" {Surah Zumar, verse 1}.

It is not said that it is revealed from any other place or
source, or from any other person. Also, it came in a way
which we cannot say how. Because being able to say how
it originated or came into being is from amongst the
specialities of a body (i.e. only if there is a physical body
can one say how something originated from it). Allaah
Ta`ala, with His Qualities is Most Lofty and is pure from

such creations. Indeed, He Speaks through this Quraan Majeed, unlike us with a mouth or tongue. Also, the Quraan Majeed originated by speech and not by notion
and understanding of the heart.

“He sent it down^1 on His Messenger as revelation. The
believers accept^2 it, as absolute truth. They are certain
that it is, in truth, the Word of Allaah. It is not created^3 .”
“He sent it down^1 on His Messenger as revelation.
1). As Allaah Taala says: **_"This Qur’aan has been revealed to me so that I may warn you with it"_** {Surah An'aam, verse 19}. Allaah Taala says: "Recite the Book (the Qur'aan)
which has been revealed to you" {Surah Ankaboot, verse 45}.
Allaah Ta`ala says: "In this manner did We send to you

(O Rasulullaah ρ ) revelation of Our command" {Surah Shura,
verse 52}. Ar-Rooh (revelation), refers to the Quraan Majeed. This is the interpretation of the majority of Mufassireen. By this (revelation of the Quraan), many nations and
communities have come ‘alive’- by virtue of the Noor of
Imaan. Hence, it is established that indeed the Qur`aan
Majeed was revealed by Wahi. It is not that it began from
the intellect, or senses or imagination, Nauthubillaah!

The believers accept^2 it, as absolute truth. They are
certain that it is, in truth, the Word of Allaah.
2). Indeed this belief is continued from the time of the
first day of Nubuwwat until today. This belief comes
directly from Allaah Υ to this blessed Ummat, through the
medium of The Chosen Rasul ρ. There is unanimity of the
entire Ummat on this, through all the eras. All through the
eras, until the last one, everyone believed that the Quraan Majeed is the Speech of Allaah Taala, by word and

meaning. It is such a speech that Allaah Ta`ala actually
Spoke it. It is not merely the inspiration of meaning and
message that it stands for.

It is not created^3.
3). Indeed Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah specially

(directly) spoke to Moosa υ " {Surah Nisaa, verse 164}. It is not
said that Allaah Ta`ala created His Speech for Moosa υ.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "When Moosa υ arrived for Our
appointment and His Rabb had spoken to him
(directly) ..." {Surah A'raaf, verse 143}. It is not said that His Rabb
created His Speech for him. Hence, His Speech emanates
from His Being; it is not a creation from Him. Also, it is
generally said: “Indeed so and so is speaking” , it is not
said: “Indeed so and so is creating his speech”. This is
quite clear and needs no further dilation. It is for this
reason that our Imaam Hadhrat Abu Hanifah ,ا -./ر said in
‘Fiqh-e-Akbar’: “The Quraan in the Masaahif (Scripture/book-form) is written, in the hearts it is memorised, on the tongues it is recited and upon The Nabi it was revealed. Our words (of recital) of the Quraan is
created, but the Qur`aan is uncreated.”

Regarding the topic under discussion, noteworthy are the
words of Sheikhul Imaam Abdul Azeez Makki, when he
was debating and discussing with the leader of the
Mutazilas, Bishr Muraisi, who claimed that the Quraan is
a creation of Allaah Taala. This took place in the court of Khalifah Mamoon. Sheikh said to Bishr: “One of three
things are inevitable for you to accept (if you claim that the
Quraan is the creation of Allaah Taala). Either you say
that indeed Allaah created His Speech in Himself. This is
impossible, because Allaah is not such an entity wherein
something can be created in His Being. Or you say that
Allaah created His Speech in someone else other than

_Himself. In that case, it would be the speech of someone
else and not His Speech. Or you say that Allaah created
His Speech to be on its own and not in any other entity or
person. That is, that it stands on its own, free of another
being or person. This also is impossible, because it is not
possible for speech to be, except from the speaker. Just like
it is not possible for intention to be except from the one
who intended, or for knowledge to be except from the
knower. One cannot understand speech from itself, which
is divested from the speaker. Just like a human or animal
speaks or makes a sound which comes from itself and it
(the sound/voice) is not an entity on its own. It is
impossible to accept that the Quraan is a creation of Allaah Taala from these three possibilities. This
(Quraan/Speech of Allaah Taala) is amongst the
Qualities of Allaah Taala and the Qualities of Allaah Taala are not created.”

********_
“As is the speech of human beings, and anyone who
hears it and claims that it is human speech has become
an unbeliever^1 .”

1). Indeed Allaah Ta`ala has named it ‘The Speech of
Allaah’ and not the speech of humans, when He says: "If
any of the Mushrikeen seek protection from you (pleads
to be left in safety to decide whether he wants to accept
Islaam) , then grant him protection until he hears the
speech of Allaah (the Qur'aan and proofs of Towheed) ,
then deliver him to his place of safety (to make up his
mind and continue living because there is no compulsion in
Deen). This is because they are a people who do not
understand (Islaam and therefore need explanations) "
{Surah Taubah, verse 6}.

Thus anyone who claims that it (Qur`aan Majeed) is the
speech of man, then he is contradicting this Aayat and
arguing its authenticity. There is no doubt that such a
person is a Kaafir.

“Allaah warns^1 him and censures him and threatens him
with Fire, then He says, Exalted is He; ‘I will burn him
in the Fire.’ When Allaah threatens with the Fire, those
who say ‘This is just human speech’, we know for certain
that it is the Speech of the Creator of mankind and that it
is totally unlike^2 the speech of mankind. Anyone who
describes Allaah as being in any way the same as a
human being has become an unbeliever^3. All those who

1). This is another proof for the Kufr of the person who
denies the Quraan Majeed being the Speech of Allaah Taala. This is also a proof that the Quraan Majeed is the Speech of Allaah Taala and not the speech of man,
because Allaah Taala has promised The Fire for that person who says that the Quraan is the speech of man. It is
thus established that the person who says that the Quraan Majeed is the speech of man is a Kaafir, Jahannami and a disputer of the Quraan.

and that it is totally unlike^2 the speech of mankind.
2). That is, His Speech is unlike that of man’s. Just like
all His other Qualities do not resemble those of man. Thus,

He Knows, not like our knowledge, His Power is unlike
ours, His Hearing and Seeing is unlike our hearing and
seeing, hence, He Speaks, not like our speech.

Anyone who describes Allaah as being in any way the
same as a human being has become an unbeliever^3. All

3). As Allaah Taala says: **_"There is nothing like Him_** _(nothing can compare with His Being or His qualities)_ **_and He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing"_** {Surah Shura, verse 11}. As has the commentary of this Aayat passed already, it denotes that this applies to _all_ the Qualities of Allaah Taala, in that it denies similarity of Allaah Taala’s Qualities to that of man’s. The import of Allaah Taala’s
Qualities are not like those of man. To compare the being
and qualities of man to that of Allaah Taala’s is Kufr, because He has denied this by saying **_"There is nothing like Him_** _(nothing can compare with His Being or His qualities)_ **_and He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing"_** {Surah Shura, verse 11}. The fact that it is mentioned with a negative resemblance, it implies denial of any similarity. Anyone who establishes any resemblance to Allaah Taala is
openly opposing this Aayat, hence it is clear-cut Kufr.
**Also, anyone who denies the Qualities of Allaah Taala is also committing Kufr** , since Allaah Taala is
confirming His Qualities, when He says: “He is All-
Hearing, All-Seeing.” Also, He says in other Aayaat: “And
He is All Wise, All-Aware”, “He is Most-High, Most-
Great” , etc. from amongst the Asmaa-ul-Husna. Therefore
that person who claims that Allaah Ta`ala is not All
Hearing, All-Seeing, All-Wise, All-Aware, Most-High or
Most Great, such a person is opposing to a greater extent
than the person mentioned before, hence this is a greater
form of Kufr.

“And refrain from saying things such as^1 the unbelievers
say, and they will know that He, in His Attributes, is not
like human beings. The seeing^2 of Allaah Ta`ala by the
people of Jannah is true.”
And refrain from saying things such as^1 the unbelievers
say, and they will know that He, in His Attributes, is not
like human beings.
1). That is like their negation of His Speech when they
say: “This is nothing except the speech of man.” Or like
the Jews when they negate Allaah Taala as being the Speaker, when they say: _“We will not bring faith in it, until we hear the Speech of Allaah with our ears.”_ And when they are made to hear Allaah Taala’s Speech, they said:
“We do not know who it was that spoke. Was it Allaah or
someone else?” They said: “We will definitely not believe
in you until we see Allaah clearly.” The aim of such
deviate statements is evil and devilish comparisons. They
are claiming that the Qualities and similitude of Allaah
Taala is like that of man. That is, (they aver that) just as we can hear the speech of man through our ears, so too can we hear the Speech of Allaah Taala in this world. They
also aver that since they can see man with their eyes, why
is it that they cannot see Allaah Ta`ala with these same
eyes in this world.

Allaah Taala has singled them out for all these spurious analogies, by which they analyse the Being of Allaah Taala to that of man’s. He rebuked them for their
statement: “This is nothing but the speech of man” , by His
saying: “I will cast him into Hell-Fire.”

The author ,ا -./ر intends that the reader also take heed from
this Divine Rebuke of Allaah Taala. He should know that he cannot compare the Speech of Allaah Taala to that of
man’s. He should not compare the Speaking and Speech of
Allaah Taala to that of man’s. **Indeed Allaah Taala, in
His Qualities is unlike man, as Allaah Ta`ala says:**
"There is nothing like Him (nothing can compare with
His Being or His qualities) and He is the All Hearing, the
All Seeing" {Surah Shura, verse 11}.

The seeing^2 **_of Allaah Taala by the people of Jannah is true._** 2). That is, it is possible for us to see Allaah Taala with
our eyes in this world. There is no impossibility in it,
neither logically nor according to Shari'ah. However,
firstly, He is present and everything that is present is
connected to sight. According to the Mutazilas, sight is restricted to the existence of the visible thing being in front of and facing the person seeing, and the establishment of distance, in such a way that it is not extremely close nor extremely far. All this is impossible in so far as Allaah Taala is concerned. Allaah Ta`ala is the One Who has
created sight in us, and He is the One Who has the Power
and Ability to alter its limitations. Just like how Nabi ρρρρ
could see in front of him and behind, even though the
visible was not opposite him.

And secondly, Hadhrat Moosa υ asked to see Allaah
Taala, by his asking: **_“O my Rabb, show me_** _(Yourself so)_ **_that I may see You”_** {Surah A'raaf, verse 143}. If it was not possible for us to be able to see Allaah Taala, then it
would follow that the one who asked for this is an ignorant
person. It is not logical to ask for something which is
impossible. The Ambiyaa are free from this (ignorance and
asking for the impossible).

This seeing (of Allaah Υ) will be realized in the Hereafter
for the inmates of Jannah. As Allaah Ta`ala says: Many
faces (the faces of the people in Jannah) on that day (of
Qiyaamah) will be resplendent (while) looking at their
Rabb" {Surah Qiyaamah, verse 22,23}.

Nabi ρ said: “Indeed you will soon (in Jannah) see your
Rabb, just like how you see the full moon.”

“Without their vision being all-encompassing^1 and
without the manner of their vision being known. As the
Book of our Rabb has expressed it: ‘Faces on that Day
radiant, looking at their Rabb.’ The explanation of this is
as Allaah Knows and Wills^2 .”

Without their vision being all-encompassing^1 and
without the manner of their vision being known. As the
Book of our Rabb has expressed it: ‘Faces on that Day
radiant, looking at their Rabb.
1). That is, we will be able to see Allaah Taala without being able to encompass Him. As Allaah Taala says;
“Sight is not able to comprehend Him.” Comprehending
Allaah Taala means to look upon Him with total encompassment. Encompassment is not a corollary of sight. As Allaah Taala says, referring to the Bani Israeel;
"When the two parties (the Bani Israa’eel and Fir'oun’s

army) set eyes on each other, Moosa υ ’s people said, “We
will surely be caught (because they are behind us and the
sea is in front of us) .” “Never!” replied Moosa, “My Rabb
is with me and He will certainly guide me (to safety) ” {Surah
Shu'araa, verses 62,63 }.

Encompassment of sight is restricted to limitations. Only
Allaah Ta`ala is free of these limitations, and similarly
from condition and explaining how (this is possible), these
are amongst the specialties of a physical body.

The explanation of this is as Allaah Knows and Wills^2.
2). That is, the intention of the statement of Allaah
Taala is as He intended it to be, and not the way we interpret it, from our opinions or the way we fathom it from our imaginations, or the way we imagine it from our whims. There is no scope for Qiyaas (Shari analogy) or opinions in such Masalas. It is necessary that we revert to
and hand over the understanding of such Masalahs to The Kitaab of Allaah Taala and the Sunnah of Rasulullaah ρ.
The pious predecessors have understood this and they have
reached a consensus upon this (that the explanation of
these things are left to Allaah Ta`ala).

Thus this maslak (way/policy) of the pious predecessors
has been passed over to the latter pious and just
generations, which refutes the distortions of the deviates,
the makers of mischief and the interpretations of the
ignorant.

1). Learning from the Aayat, where Allaah Ta`ala says:
“...except for him who comes to Allaah with a sound
(pure, sincere) heart" {Surah Shu'araa, verse 89} - A sound heart is
that one which is cleansed and purified by Allaah.

and leaves the knowledge of things that are ambiguous to
the One Who Knows^2 them.
2). As Allaah Taala says: **_"ask the people of knowledge if you do not know"_** {Surah Nahl, verse 43}. As Allaah Taala says:
"And do not pursue what you have no knowledge about
(do not comment on subjects you have no knowledge about
or speak about something that has not been verified).
Indeed questioning (on the Day of Qiyaamah) shall take
place with regard to (what) the ears (heard) , (what) the
eyes (saw) and (what thoughts and wrong beliefs) the
hearts (harboured) " {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 36}.

And Allaah Ta`ala says: "There are those people who,
without (relevant) knowledge, dispute with you about (the
being, the attributes or actions of) Allaah and they follow
(the dictates of) every rebellious Shaytaan" {Surah Hajj, verse 3}.

A man’s Islaam is not secure unless it is based^3 on
submission and surrender.”
3). As Allaah Taala says: **_"Definitely the only Deen_** _(religion)_ **_with Allaah_** _(acceptable by Allaah)_ **_is Islaam"_** {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 19}. Islaam means and denotes submission, compliance and surrendering. As Allaah Taala states:

"When his (Ibraheem υ ’s) Rabb told him, “Surrender
(your will and soul) ,” he replied, “I surrender (and devote
myself) to the Rabb of the universe" {Surah Baqara, verse 131}.
That is, hand over your affairs to Us, and you be under the
subjugation of Allaah Taala in all affairs of your life and death. Just like how the dead is in the hands of the bathers. Then Allaah Taala expounds on this by saying: "Say,
'Truly my salaah, all my acts of worship, my life and my
death are for Allaah, the Rabb of the universe.He
(Allaah) has no partner. With this (Towheed) have I been
commanded (to adhere to) and I am the first of the
Muslims'” {Surah, verses 162,163}. Allaah Ta`ala ordered him
(Hadhrat Ibraheem υ) with submission, and He explained it
to be Islaam.

***********************************************
********
“Anyone who desires to know things which is beyond his
capacity to know, and whose intellect is not content^1 with
surrender, will find that his desire veils him from a pure
understanding of Allaah’s true Unity, clear knowledge
and correct belief, confirmation and denial and
acceptance and rejection. He will be subject to
whisperings and find himself confused and full of doubt,
being neither an accepting believer nor a denying
rejecter.”

1). That is, how will that person who relies solely on his
intellect and only on his opinion and conjectures
understand the principles of the Deen of Allaah Taala, without using the Kitaab of Allaah (Quraan Majeed) and

the Sunnah of Rasulullaah ρ? How can anyone interpret
the Quraan Majeed without relying on the Tafseer made by Rasulullaah ρ and His Sahabah ψ? Those amongst whom the Quraan was revealed in their language and they
understood it through the Blessed tongue of Nubuwwat, in
the very presence of the Rasool of Allaah (sallallahu alaihi
wasallam).

Nabi ρ said: “He who speaks regarding the Quraan through his opinion, should prepare his abode in the Fire.”_ In another narration it is reported: _“He who speaks regarding the Quraan without knowledge, he should
prepare his abode in the Fire.”

The guiding principle here is that the core and essence of
the Deen is submission to Allaah Taala and not understanding through our intellect and knowledge. If this was the case (that Deen depended on intellect), then there would be no need for the sending Ambiyaa or Divine Scriptures. Also, there would be no need for Tafseer of these Kitaabs by Wahi, and there would be no need for Nabi ρ to say that after him there would be those who will be his inheritors who will teach the Quraan and Sunnah.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "Thereafter (after revealing the

Qur'aan to Rasulullaah ρ ) , We made those of Our
bondsmen whom We chose (the Mu'mineen) inheritors of
the Book (the Qur'aan). Of them were those who
oppressed their souls (by committing sins) , while there
were those who were moderate (who neither sinned, nor
did more than the Faraa’idh and Waajibaat). There were
also those who were leaders in good deeds by the
command of their Rabb (those who refrained from sin and

besides the Faraa’idh and Waajibaat, also excelled in
performing optional good deeds) " {Surah Faatir, verse 32}.

Hence, that person who speaks regarding the Deen, such
things which are from his conjectures and he understands it
to be the Deen, but it has no connection to the Kitaab of
Allaah, neither with what Allaah Taala intended or expounded through the Blessed tongue of His Nabi ρ, nor is it in line with the way of the pious predecessors. Indeed such a person is speaking of his own opinion and he is a great sinner, _even_ if he is (coincidentally) correct. Whereas that person who speaks from the Quraan Majeed and
Sunnah, will be rewarded, even of he is incorrect. But if he
is correct then he will be greatly rewarded.

***********************************************
********
“Belief of a man in the ‘seeing of Allaah by the people of
Jannah’ is not correct^1 if he imagines what it is like, or
interprets it according to his own understanding”

1). That is, Imaan is connected to following what has
been revealed and with submission, not with the
interpretation of the intellect and whims. Indeed, this
(latter) is deviation, as Allaah Ta`ala says: 7. It was He

(Allaah) who revealed to you (O Muhammad ε ) the book
in which lies ‘Muhkamaat’ (clear and unambiguous)
verses that are the mother (essence, core) of the Qur'aan
and others that are ‘Mutashaabihaat’ (verses to which no
specific or exact meaning can be given). As for those who
have crookedness in their hearts, they pursue (try to
interpret) the ‘Mutashaabihaat’, thereby seeking to cause
mischief (causing doubts in the minds of the ignorant) and
seeking their interpretation. None knows their
interpretation except Allaah. Those who are sound in

knowledge (who are not proud and are content with their
intellectual achievements and the strength of their Imaan)
say, “We believe in them (because out intellect falls short
of understanding them). All (the Muhkamaat and the
Mutashaabihaat) are from our Rabb.” None take heed
besides men of understanding.

Allaah Taala has refuted and invalidated the interpretation of the _Mutashaabihaat (unclear verses)_ and He has encouraged and advocated submission regarding them and accepting them without making any interpretation in them. Also, how can one bring Imaan in those interpretations of the Commandments of Allaah Taala ( Muhkamaat) , which
are interpreted by mere natural intellect and whims, which
have not been nurtured by (qualified) teachers, and not
been purified by following the pious, and has not been
coloured with the colours of Allaah, and has not been
guided by the guidance of the servants of Allaah Ta`ala.
Indeed the likes of such interpretations are exegesis of the
whims and imaginations. Indeed, that Imaan with the
intellect and not by submission, with interpretations
‘cooked-up’ by the imaginations and whims and not
researched by Ijtihaad. These are all Faasid (corrupt)
interpretations.

Nevertheless, the correct and authentic interpretations are
in line with the object and import of The Speaker. It is not
fabrications.

“Since the interpretation of this ‘seeing’ or indeed, the

negating the Attributes of Allaah, or likening Allaah to
something else, has gone astray^1 and has failed to
understand Allaah’s Glory, because our Rabb, The
Glorified and The Exalted can only possibly be described
on Oneness and Absolute Singularity.”

1). Indeed moderation is the distinguishing factor
between emergence and falling astray. In it there will be no
resemblance of or a denial of Allaah’s Attributes,
especially in the ‘seeing’, as has just been established
earlier on. Indeed, to make a resemblance of or deny
altogether the Attributes of Allaah Ta`ala, are the results of
making use of only one’s intellect and incorrect analogies.
These factors give rise to excessiveness.

Hence, some of them make a resemblance of Allaah Taala according to His Attributes and others negate His Attributes altogether. Thus, those who deny His Attributes altogether, worship nothing and those who make a resemblance of Him worship idols. Those who believe in the Oneness of Allaah Taala worship the Independent,
Eternal Absolute.

Rabb, The Glorified and The Exalted can only possibly

{Surah Ikhlaas, verse 1}. That is, in His Being and Attributes.

and Absolute Singularity.
3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah is Independent
(while He needs no one and nothing, everyone and
everything needs Him). He has no children and is not
anyone’s child" {Surah Ikhlaas, verses 2,3}.

***********************************************
********
“And no^1 creation is in any way like Him.”

1). As Allaah Taala says: **_“There is none equal to Him_** _(neither in His Being nor in His qualities)"_ {Surah Ikhlaas, verse 4}_._ The statement of the Author which confirms the Oneness and Unity of Allaah Taala, negates His complete
denial. His saying “And no creation is in any way like
him” negates any comparison. Hence the Deen of Allaah
Taala is just and moderate, there are no excesses in it. It does not comprise of only assertions or complete negation. For example, if we take the Masalah of The Being (of
Allaah Taala) in the Kalimah of Towheed- it does not comprise of negation of the Being of Allaah Taala nor
does it assert a multitude of beings. It confirms the
Oneness of the Being of Allaah Taala and negates the multitude of deities. Similarly, if we consider the Masalah
of the Attributes of Allaah Taala, in it there is also assertion and negation. The confirmation is that these Qualities of Allaah Taala do exist in Him, have always
existed and will always be in existence. The negation is
that they are unlike that of any other creation of Allaah
Taala, in any way whatsoever. It is not possible for any of the creation to be in any way similar to The Creator. There is no partner, equal, similarity or match to Allaah Taala.

This is moderation and a mid-way. If one tends to the one
end he will fall out and if he tends to the other, he will
falter and be deviated. The way to this is the Quraan Majeed, which is a summary between negation and assertion, in so far as the Being and Attributes of Allaah Taala are concerned. If you desire confirmation regarding
the Attributes of Allaah Ta`ala, refer to (the Aayat): He is
Allaah, there is no Ilaah but He. He is the Knower of the
unseen and the seen. He is the Most Compassionate, the
Most Merciful. He is Allaah besides Whom there is no
Ilaah. He is the Sovereign, the Most Pure, the Giver of
peace, the Giver of security, the Vigilant, the Mighty, the
Overpowering, the Glorious. He is Pure from whatever
(partners) they (the Mushrikeen) ascribe to Him. (None
can compare with His being, attributes or actions.) He is
Allaah, the Creator, the Perfect Maker, the Fashioner
Who has the most beautiful names. Whatever is in the
heavens and the earth glorifies Him. He is the Mighty
(with absolute power) , the Wise (with absolute knowledge
and wisdom)" {Surah Hashar, verses 22-24}.

If you require negation, refer to: "There is nothing like
Him (nothing can compare with His Being or His
qualities) and He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing" {Surah
Shura, verse 11}.

Hence, by saying ‘His Unique Attributes’ (Sifaatil
Wahdaaniyah) means that there is no equal that resembles
Him. By saying ‘His Exceptional Descriptives’ (Nuootul Fardaaniyah) means that there is none similar to Him. The (Arabic) words “Wasf” and “Naat” are similar words with
similar meanings. ‘Wasf’ refers to the being and ‘Na`at’
refers to Actions. Also the words ‘Wahdaaniyat’ and

‘Fardaaniyat’ differ from each other in that the former
refers to the Being and the latter to Attributes.

***********************************************
********
“He is beyond having limits^1 placed on Him.”

1). As Allaah Taala says: **_Allaah surrounds_** _(has knowledge of and is in control of)_ **_everything"_** {Surah Nisaa, verse 126}. Allaah Taala says: Allaah is The Possessor of
abundance, The Wise" {Surah Nisaa, verse 130}. This means that
everything, besides Allaah Taala is restricted as far as its being, actions and qualities are concerned. And also with regard to everything that emanates from it. As Allaah Taala says: Everything is perfectly stipulated with Him
(nothing can exceed or be less than the periods and
specifications He sets) " {Surah Ra'ad, verse 8}. As Allaah Ta`ala
says: "We have with Us the treasures of all things (rain,
mineral wealth, food, spiritual guidance, etc) and We send
them down only in stipulated quantities (as the need
arises, according to Allaah’s wisdom)" {Surah Hijr, verse 21}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: “We have certainly created
everything by (finely calculated) measure" {Surah Qamar, verse
49}

It is therefore established that indeed everything has been
created with limits and measures in so far as its creation,
body, soul and all other attributes are concerned. These
specified limits are the restraints of things; nothing can go
beyond its specified and allotted limits. The only One Who
can allow these limitations to be surpassed is Allaah
Taala, Alone, since He is the Creator of everything and He is the Only One Who can do it. As Allaah Taala says:
“We have created it” , and He says: “We have revealed it.”

All these limitations and restrictions are encompassed by
Allaah Taala. He encompasses everything. So how can it be possible for the One Who encompasses everything to be restrained by anything? Hence it is confirmed by virtue of these Aayaat that the being and Attributes of Allaah Taala
are completely unrestrained and unlimited, whereas the
creation is limited.

***********************************************
********
“Or being restricted^1 , or having limbs^2 ”

Or being restricted^1 ,
1). As Allaah Taala says: **_The end_** _(destination of every person)_ **_shall surely be to your Rabb_** _(Who will evaluate your actions and either reward or punish you for them)_ **_"_** {Surah Najm, verse 42}. Allaah Taala says: Verily the return (of
every person on the Day of Qiyaamah) shall be to your
Rabb" {Surah Alaq, verse 8}. Allaah Taala says: **_to Him alone will all matters return_** _(He will judge all matters on the Day of Qiyaamah)_ **_"_** {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 109}. Allaah Taala
says: “We hear (Allaah’s commands) and we obey. (We
ask) Your forgiveness, (O) our Rabb. To You is our
return” {Surah Baqara, verse 285}. These Aayaat all relate to and
confirm that indeed everything will end and return to
Allaah Taala. But, He will neither end nor return to anything. This confirms that everything returns and will end up by Him. This also confirms that He is free from limitations and terminations. Allaah Taala is limitless and
interminable.

or having limbs^2
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Say, 'He Allaah is One.
Allaah is Independent (while He needs no one and
nothing, everyone and everything needs Him) '" {Surah Ikhlaas,

verses 1,2}. The explanation of this is that parts and limbs are
from the compositions of matter. Allaah Taala is One and He is not separable into parts and segments, as Allaah Taala says: “He Allaah is One”. The inference of parts
and limbs is that they are objects that are different from
one another and no two limbs are exactly the same,
whereas Allaah Taala is free from being segregated or separated. Also, in limbs there is the inference of breakages, whereas, Allaah Taala is free from breaking or
being broken, as Allaah Ta`ala says: "When He wills
anything, His only command is to say, “Be!” and it
comes into being" {Surah Yaaseen, verse 82}.

Hence, it is confirmed that Allaah Taala has no parts or limbs. Yes, Allaah Taala has placed means and has
created things which He has made a means for the
occurrence of other things. But, even these means are His
creations and they all depend upon Him, and it is not that
He depends on any of them. He demonstrates His
Greatness in the effecting of these means. This is His
Wisdom and not a sign of weakness. These means are also
amongst His creations and they all depend upon Him.

Take note! The names of limbs and parts that are used for
Allaah Taala in the Quraan and Sunnah, like, hand, face,
feet, fingers, nails, eyes, shin, cheeks, etc. are NOT in the
meaning of the limbs and parts of man.

In fact, their meaning and import are as are appropriate to
the Greatness and Being of Allaah Ta`ala.

Just like His Being is unlike ours, His Attributes are unlike
ours, His Actions are unlike ours; similarly, the words used
to describe Him are unlike the (same) words used to
describe us. Hence, the way of Islaam is that we regard

these words upon their actual meaning, and we say
regarding them, as Imaam Maalik ,ا -./ر has said: “Indeed
their meanings are known, but their actual condition is
unknown, to bring Imaan (faith) in them is Waajib, but to
question regarding them is Bid`ah.” Indeed we will not
understand it nor can we comprehend it.

***********************************************
********

“Or parts^1 ”
1). Indeed in this (parts, components), there is a meaning
of benefit, and Allaah Taala is free from benefit and harm. He cannot be benefited or harmed, because indeed He is the Owner of benefit and harm. He has created them and they are subjected and subservient to him. As Allaah Taala says: Say, “Who has any power against Allaah if
He intends any harm to afflict you or if He intends any
good to come to you? No (none has the power). Allaah is
Ever Aware of what you do (and will punish you for your
sins) ” {Surah Fatah, verse 11}.

Is it possible or fathomable, for benefit of man to benefit
the Creator thereof? Or for the harm of man to harm the
Creator thereof? It would then be a combination of
opposites, in that One Who is Independent from harm and
benefit can be harmed or benefited. Indeed one of His
Lofty names is “An-Naafi”. He does whatever He pleases, as Allaah Taala says: "surely Allaah is Independent of
the entire universe" {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 97}.

Allaah Ta`ala is free from any wants or parts or elements.
He does not have to earn anything. His saying: "When He

wills anything, His only command is to say, “Be!” and it
comes into being" {Surah Yaaseen, verse 82}. This demonstrates
His Absolute Independence from all things.

Allaah Ta`ala negates His dependence on anything, by
saying: “Allaah is Independent”. This means that He is
independent of all and all are dependent on Him.

***********************************************
********
“Nor is He contained by the six directions^1 as all created
things are.”

1). As Allaah Taala says: **_"...whereas Allaah surrounds them from all over"_** {Surah Burooj, verse 20}. When it is said that Allaah Taala surrounds them from all over,
then it implies that He encompasses from all the six
directions. Directions are behind everything and it
encompasses all things. And for Him Who encompasses
all things, it is not possible for anything to encompass Him
or to be behind Him. Otherwise it would be a combination
of opposites, since it is impossible for The Encompasser to
be encompassed. Allaah Taala is free of and beyond any of the six direction. It is also established that He has full and total cognisance of all the directions, because He encompasses everything. So, if for example, one says that there is a top of Allaah, then this would not be possible because, Allaah Taala is above everything, and His
Attributes are All-Encompassing and there can be nothing
above Him. If one considers the bottom, then He is Baatin
(internal) there is nothing below Him. It is also established
from the Ahaadith that Allaah Taala is above and below everything. So since we have established that Allaah Taala has no top or bottom, then the right, left, front and
back would follow suit. The right side is stipulated in

accordance with Him, as Allaah Ta`ala says: So (the first
group are) the people of the right (the average
Mu'mineen) ; how excellent are the people of the right!
(They are referred to as the “people of the right” because
they will receive the record of their actions in their right
hands, indicating entry into Jannah.) And (the second
group are) the people of the left; how wretched are the
people of the left! (They are referred to as the “people of
the left” because they will receive the record of their
actions in their left hands, indicating entry into
Jahannam.)

He is behind the entire creation and ahead of them, leading
them on, because He is indeed The First. He is behind the
entire creation and He will be even there after them, as He
says: “And We are the Inheritors”.

He will bring to light on the Day of Qiyaamah, after
differentiating between the obedient and the disobedient,
the sincere and the insincere (Munaafiqeen). He leads
people onto the Path, and the entire creation walk behind
Him.
In short, it is established that Allaah Taala is not restricted to any of the six directions, in fact, He is the yardstick for them. As Allaah Taala says: "Wherever you turn, you
will find Allaah’s presence there" {Surah Baqara, verse 115}.
Allaah Ta`ala is the criterion by which the directions are
measured and not anyone or anything besides Him. This
proves that no direction overwhelms Him, rather He
overwhelms all directions. In fact, He overwhelms and
encompasses all six directions.

“Al-Mi`raaj^1 (the Ascent through the heavens) is true,
Nabi ρρρρ was taken by night^2 .”
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Pure is that Being Who

transported His slave (Rasulullaah ρ ) by night from
Masjidul Haraam (in Makkah) to Masjidul Aqsa (in
Jerusalem) " {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 1}.

This was the first stage of the Ascent, i.e. from Masjid-e-
Haraam to Masjid-e-Aqsa. The second stage was the ascent
from Masjid-e-Aqsa to the heavens and then onto the
Sidratul Muntahaa. And then to Allaah Υ. As Allaah

Ta`ala says: "He (Rasulullaah ρ ) certainly saw him
(Jibra’eel υ in his original form ) once more (a second
time) at the Sidratul Muntahaa (when Rasulullaah ρ went
on the miraculous journey of Mi’raaj) close to which is

Jannahul Ma’waa. (Rasulullaah ρ saw Jibra’eel υ there)
When the Sidratul Muntahaa was covered by that which
covered it. (When the Sidratul Muntahaa was covered by
magnificent colours or angels, it assumed a new
appearance and became more beautiful than any human
can describe.)" {Surah Najm, verses 13-16}.

2). This is an indication towards the physical Mi`raaj.
Indeed the Slave is an embodiment of body and soul, not
just a soul, otherwise it would have been said that he was
taken by soul or his soul was taken.

“And ascended in his bodily form, while awake^1 , through
the heavens, to whatever heights Allaah willed for Him.
Allaah ennobled in the way that He ennobled him and
revealed to him what He revealed to him, ‘And his heart

was not mistaken about what it saw’. Allaah blessed him
and granted him peace in this world and the next. Al-
Howdh^2 (the Pool which Allaah will grant Nabi -
sallallahu alaihi wasallam , as an honour to quench the
thirst of his Ummat on the Day of Qiyaamah) is true. Al-

1). Indeed this is a miracle which did not take place
except in the state of wakefulness. If the Miraaj did not took place in a sleep or with soul only, then it would not have been any extraordinary feat. This is possible with a non-Nabi also, therefore, it could not have been classified as a Mujizah.

Al-Howdh^2 (the Pool which Allaah will grant Nabi -
sallallahu alaihi wasallam , as an honour to quench the
thirst of his Ummat on the Day of Qiyaamah) is true.
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Verily We have granted you

(O Rasulullaah ρ !) the Al Kowthar" {Surah Kowthar, verse }.
Rasulullaah ρ said: “Do you know what is Kowthar?” The
Sahaabah replied: “Allaah and His Rasool know best.” He

said: “It is a pond which I have been granted by Allaah Υ
in Jannah....”

It is reported in Bukhari Shareef from Rasulullaah ρ:
“Indeed I will precede you at the Howdh and whoever

passes by will have a drink from it. Whosoever drinks from
it will never be thirsty thereafter.”

The Ahaadith that have been reported regarding this have
reached the level of Tawaatur (Consistent and authentic).
It has been reported from more than 30 Sahaabah. Imaam
Ibn Katheer ,ا -./ر has written a detailed exegesis on this
subject in his famous work of “Al-Bidaayah wan
Nihaayah” , whosoever desires, he may refer to it.

Al-Shifaah_**^3 **_, (the Intercession which is stored up for Muslims), is true, as related in the consistent and confirmed Ahaadith._** 3). As Allaah Taala says: Intercession (on behalf of
anyone) cannot profit (another) in His presence, except
for the one whom He permits (intercession) **"** {Surah Saba, verse
23}. Allaah Ta`ala says: **"only the one with whom He is
pleased will be able to intercede_** (on behalf of anyone on
the Day of Qiyaamah) " {Surah Ambiyaa, verse 28}.** Intercession
begins with negation so that the people may not depend
upon or rely on the intercession of their Auliyaa or pious
predecessors.

The Intercession (on the day of Qiyaamah) will be of
different stages, as is reported in the Ahaadith; the
“Shafaa`atul Kubra” (Great Intercession) will be in favour
of all mankind, so that the reckoning may begin; there will
be the Intercession for the sinners; the Intercession for the
salvation of those who have already been entered into the
Fire; the Intercession for the raising of the stages in
Jannah; etc.

Also, there will be different types of Intercessors from
amongst the Believers; the Ambiyaa, the Angels, the

Ulama, the Shuhadaa (Martyrs), the Sulahaa (Pious), the
Huffaaz, etc.

“The covenant^1 which Allaah made with Hadhrat Aadam
and his offspring is true. Allaah knew^2 , before the
existence of time, the exact number of those who would
enter Jannah and the exact number of those who would
enter the Fire. This number will neither be increased nor
decreased. The same applies to all actions^3 done by
people, which are done exactly as Allaah knew they
would be done. Everyone is eased^4 to what he was created
for.”

The covenant^1 which Allaah made with Hadhrat Aadam
and his offspring is true.
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "(Remember also the time
before man was sent to earth) When your Rabb extracted
from the backs of the children of Aadam their
descendants and (after proving to them that He is their
Rabb) called them to witness over themselves saying, “Am
I not your Rabb?” They replied, “Certainly! We testify to
it” {Surah A'raaf, verse 172}.

Allaah knew^2 , before the existence of time, the exact
number of those who would enter Jannah and the exact
number of those who would enter the Fire.
2). As Allaah Taala says: **_A group shall be in Jannah, while another shall be in the Blaze_** _(Jahannam)"_ {Surah Shura, verse 7}. This is clear based on His Knowledge. As Allaah Taala says: "verily Allaah has knowledge of all things"
{Surah Maa'idah, verse 97}. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "He has
knowledge of their conditions and He keeps meticulous
count of everything " {Surah Jinn, verse 28}. And this number (of

the inmates of Jannah and Jahannam) is also included in
this encompassing.

This number will neither be increased nor decreased. The
same applies to all actions^3 done by people, which are
done exactly as Allaah knew they would be done.
3). Because actions are created by Allaah Υ. He says:
“And Allaah has created you and whatever you do” {Surah
Saaffaat, verse 96} And everything that He creates, He knows
about it before He creates it. As Allaah Ta`ala says: “Does
the One Who created (you and your actions) not know "
{Surah Mulk, verse 14}

Everyone is eased^4 to what he was created for.
4). As Allaah Ta`ala says: As for the one (the Mu'min)
who gives (charity to the needy) , who has Taqwa and who
believes in the most beautiful word (the Kalimah) We
shall make the (means to attain) great comfort (Jannah)
easy for him (by making it easy for him to carry out good
deeds). As for the one who is miserly and indifferent
(towards the truth of Islaam) and who rejects the most
beautiful word (the Kalimah) We shall make the (means
to attain) great grief (Jahannam) easy for him (by making
it easy for him to commit sins) " {Surah Layl, verses 5-10}.

“And it is the action^1 with which a man’s life is sealed
which dictates his fate.”

1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Verily those who commit
kufr and die as Kuffaar, the earth full of gold shall never
be accepted from any of them if they ever wish to offer it

as ransom (to save themselves from punishment on the
Day of Qiyaamah). For them shall be a painful
punishment and they shall have no helpers (to save them
from Allaah’s punishment) " {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 91}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "Forgiveness is not for those who
(continue to) commit evil acts (without repenting) and
then, when death presents itself before any of them (and
they can see the angels of death before them) , he says,
‘Now I repent!’ Nor is it (forgiveness) for those who die
as Kuffaar (and who repent in the Aakhirah. Such people
will never be forgiven). We have prepared for such people
a painful punishment" {Surah Nisaa, verse 18}.

Allaah Taala did not shackle the Truth by His saying: **_"Verily those who commit kufr and die as Kuffaar, the earth full of gold shall never be accepted from any of them if they ever wish to offer it as ransom_** _(to save themselves from punishment on the Day of Qiyaamah)_**_. For them shall be a painful punishment and they shall have no helpers_** _(to save them from Allaah’s punishment)_ **_"_** {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 91}. In fact, He Subhaanahu Wa Taala added
the words: die as Kuffaar. This is a point of reflection in
that Allaah Taala is not merely stating that they just die, but that they die whilst in the state of kufr. The object here is not to explain the mere dying of the kufaar, but it is to demonstrate the end condition of their death, i.e. they die whilst upon kufr. The warning is on this final condition of their lives, which will warrant for them a painful and a fearful punishment. This object would not have been fully achieved except by the words, **_die as Kuffaar_**. Had the Aayat read: _“Indeed those who are kaafir or they die”_ , then it would have meant that even the person who died as a kaafir in our eyes, yet he was a Mumin, i.e. he made
Taubah and his Taubah was accepted by Allaah Ta`ala,

and his Imaan was accepted prior to his death, then that
person would also be liable for the punishment. This would
have necessitated that a person’s end condition meant
nothing, i.e. whether a person died as a kaafir or a
Believer. It is for this reason that Allaah Ta`ala added the
words die as Kuffaar. This confirms that the final and
decisive moment in a person’s life is the last stage. Thus,
indeed, death is the completion and the conclusion of one’s
life and not the thing which brings to an abrupt end. The
final moments of a person’s life, that which is connected to
the final condition of Imaan, will not change until eternity.
Thus we learn from this that the retribution of anything is
in accordance to the condition of its final moments. It is
that condition upon which it was steadfast upon, and its
final moments came in that condition. This is the meaning
of the saying of Rasulullaah ρ, as stated in the Bukhaari
and Muslim: “Indeed a person who carries out the actions
of the inmates of Jannah, in the eyes of the people, (yet) he
is from amongst the inmates of the Fire, and indeed a man
carries out the actions of the inmates of the Fire, in the
eyes of the people, and (yet) he is from amongst the
inmates of Jannah.” The following is added in Bukhaari:
“And indeed (the decisive) actions are those at (the time
of) death.”

This Hadith is a commentary of these Aayaat, which prove
to us that a person’s final actions and condition will be the
decisive factor in this world and the Hereafter.

need to know and constitutes the degree of those firmly
endowed with knowledge. For there are two kinds of
knowledge.”

“Those who are fortunate^1 are fortunate by the Decree
of Allaah, and those who are wretched are wretched by
the decree of Allaah.
1). A fortunate person is a rightly guided one. An
unfortunate person is one who is astray. Both these are in
accordance to the Decree and Will of Allaah Taala. As Allaah Taala says: "There can be no guide for the one
whom Allaah sends astray and none can mislead the one
whom Allaah guides" {Surah Zumar, verses 36,37}. Or it is said that
guidance and deviation are the effects of good and bad
fortune that are inherent in a person. If effects are from
amongst the Decrees of Allaah Taala, then all the more, the effected are from the Decree of Allaah Taala, since
they are created by Him.

The exact nature^2 of the Decree is Allaah’s secret in His
creation, and no angel near the Throne, nor Rasul sent
with a Message, has been given knowledge of it. Delving
into it and reflecting too much about it only leads to
destruction and loss, and results in rebelliousness. So be

of Allaah’s friends with enlightened hearts need to know
and constitutes the degree of those firmly endowed with
knowledge. For there are two kinds of knowledge.
2). As far as the basic Masalah regarding _Qadr_ (predestination/Decree of Allaah Taala) is concerned, it is
from amongst the absolute beliefs of our Deen, as has been
explained with the rational and revealed proofs.

The difference between Masheeyat (Divine Decree) and
Ridaa (Divine approval/Pleasure) will be explained later
on. Thus, as far as the actual Mas`alah is concerned, and its
ruling is concerned they are understandable and it is not
such that it boggles the mind or intellect.

Except that the source and core of Taqdeer , it is a secret
from amongst the secrets of Allaah Taala, which is beyond the understanding and intellect of the human mind. It is an actions from amongst the Actions of Allaah Taala.
He is not asked about it, but we will be asked regarding our
actions. He created everything and measured it according
to proper measure. **Everything is subservient to the Will
and Decree of Allaah Taala.** Indeed Allaah Taala
created his slaves and their actions. He is the One Who
intends kufr for the Kaafir, and He creates it and Wills it,

but He is not pleased with it. He has Willed it in
accordance to His Divine Wisdom. As for the basis and the
core of the Masa`ala of Qadr , this is another matter, which
is very delicate and extremely subtle. Its understanding and
comprehension is far beyond the intellect of man.

None understands the reality of it, besides Allaah Υ. The
understanding and the intellect of man cannot comprehend
it. Deviate are the ones who delve into it and successful are
the ones who accept and believe in it. This is from the rules
of Towheed. Hence, that person who believes in the
Oneness of Allaah Taala and belies the concept of _Taqdeer_ , his belying destroys his belief in Towheed. May Allaah Taala save us from such misfortunes.

“Knowledge which is accessible^1 to created beings and
knowledge which is inaccessible^2 to created beings.
Denying the knowledge that is accessible is disbelief, and
claiming the knowledge that is inaccessible is disbelief.
Belief can only be firm when accessible knowledge is
accepted and inaccessible knowledge is not sought after.”

“Knowledge which is accessible^1 to created beings
1). This refers to that knowledge that was brought by the
Ambiyaa #"م$ا '()+, which was concise and detailed, comprised
of negations and confirmations. This is the knowledge of
the Shari'ah. This is on the level of those who delve deep
into knowledge. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Those who are
sound in knowledge (who are not proud and are content
with their intellectual achievements and the strength of
their Imaan) say, “We believe in them (because our
intellect falls short of understanding them). All* (the
Muhkamaat and the Mutashaabihaat) are from our

Rabb.” None take heed besides men of understanding"
{Surah Aal Imraan, verse 7}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Hold fast to what (commands) the

Rasool ρρρρ gives you and refrain from what (actions) He
prevents you (because whatever he instructs you is from
Allaah) " {Surah Hashar, verse 7}.

This is the knowledge which is accessible, with all its
corollaries, like experience, examples, narratives, etc. This
is all that is accessible in the Quraan Majeed and Sunnah. Everything besides this is the inaccessible knowledge, which excludes forgetfulness. There is no way to understanding this type of knowledge, either by thought or reflection. As Allaah Taala said, from Hadhrat Ibraheem
υ: "O my father! Such knowledge has come to me that
has not come to you, so follow me and I shall show you
the straight path” {Surah Maryam, verse 43}. This is the knowledge
of the Shari'ah.

and knowledge which is inaccessible^2 to created beings.
Denying the knowledge that is accessible is disbelief, and
claiming the knowledge that is inaccessible is disbelief.
Belief can only be firm when accessible knowledge is
accepted and inaccessible knowledge is not sought after.”
2). An example of this knowledge is the secrets of
predestination which Allaah Taala has concealed from man. He has prohibited them from probing into it. Also, the knowledge of the reality of the Rooh (soul). As Allaah Taala says: "You have been granted only a little bit of
knowledge" {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 85}. Also, the knowledge of
the advent of Qiyaamah, as Allaah Ta`ala says: "They ask

you (O Muhammad ε ) about Qiyaamah, when will it
occur? Say, “The knowledge of this is with my Rabb (only
Allaah knows when it will occur). Only He will make it

appear it on its time. It (the occurrence of Qiyaamah) will
be weighty on the heavens and the earth and will appear
suddenly.” They ask you as if you have perfect knowledge
of it. Say, “The knowledge of this is only with Allaah, but
most people do not know.” (We are aware only of the

signs of Qiyaamah, as mentioned by Rasulullaah ρ .) " {Surah
A'raaf, verse 187}.

Also the knowledge of the principles of the unseen, as
Allaah Taala says: **_"With Him are the keys_** _(the knowledge)_ **_of the unseen, about which none besides Him has any knowledge"_** {Surah An'aam, verse 59}. Also the knowledge of the condition of the ability of creation and eternity or the knowledge of their reality, as Allaah Taala

says: "Verily the knowledge of (when) Qiyaamah (will
come) is only with Allaah. He sends the rains and knows
(the details of) what is in the wombs (such as the
character and future of the child). A soul does not know
what it will earn tomorrow and neither does it know in
which land it will die. Undoubtedly Allaah is All Knowing
(only He knows all of these things and everything else) ,
Informed" {Surah Luqmaan, verse 34}.

That person who denies anything of that which Rasulullaah
ρ brings, he is amongst the Kaafireen. That person who
claims to know that knowledge which is hidden from man,
is amongst the atheists and deviates. May Allaah Ta`ala
save us from such beliefs.

every good act regardless of how insignificant it may

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Behold! Verily they (some

Behold! (Even) When they wear their clothes (thinking

wrongdoers)'" {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 29}.

Thus, He is knowledgeable of all that has happened, is
happening and will happen until eternity. He Knows it
before it is created and even after it is created. All this is
written by Him in the Mother of all Kitaabs (Al-Lahw Al
Mahfooz). Many have gone astray on this point, like the
Mushrikeen, philosophers, Saaibeen, etc. in their refuting
His Knowledge of things before its creation. All this is
included in falsifying Taqdeer.

This falsification necessitates their refutation of His
knowledge being All-Encompassing. These Aayaat is a
clear refutation of their beliefs.

Indeed Allaah Ta`ala has destined everything to the finest
detail even before its creation. Those who refute this, are
refuting His Power and knowledge and they are not

Thus He is the One Who decreases in His creation, and
there is none else, because there is only One Creator. It is
simpler to decrease than to increase, and since He has the
Power and Ability to increase, He can all the easier
decrease as well. None else has power over this besides
Him since He is the Creator and none else.

And there is no created^3 thing except with His creation.”
3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Indeed those (gods) that
you worship besides Allaah can never even create
(something as little and insignificant as) a fly (which
Allaah has created in great abundance) even though all of
them join forces in this effort. (In fact,) If a (weak and
insignificant) fly has to steal anything from them (from
these gods) , they (are so helpless that they) cannot (even)
retrieve it. The seeker (the Mushrikeen) and the sought
(their gods) are both weak (feeble and helpless)" {Surah Hajj,
verse 73}.

At-Takween means to create. A thing can neither be a
created thing except by His creation nor a formed or
shaped thing except by His forming or shaping. This

applies to all qualities. A thing can neither be blessed
except with His Mercy nor sanctified except with His
Munificence. A person can neither be knowledgeable
except with His bestowing of Knowledge neither an owner
except with His granting ownership. None can be sustained
except with His Sustenance nor be led astray except with
His misleading nor be guided aright except with His
guidance, etc. etc. There is neither a creator except He nor
any shaper except He. There is no Most Merciful, except
He or Sustainer except He, or Guider except He, or
Teacher except He, or All Wise, except He, etc. etc. This is
so because there is No deity but He. This is the crux and
basis of our belief. We believe that everything happens
with His Orders and Knowledge. He is the Creator and
Protector.

“And At-Takween^1 (creation) is not executed except with
beauty and perfection. This^2 is a fundamental aspect of
belief and a necessary element of all knowledge and
recognition of Allaah’s Oneness and Rabubiyyat. As
Allaah says in His Book: ‘He created everything and
Decreed it in a detailed way’. And He also says: ‘Allaah’s
Command is always a decided Decree.’”

“And At-Takween^1 (creation) is not executed except with
beauty and perfection.
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: " (This is all) The doing of
Allaah Who perfects everything (just as Allaah grants
strength to weak things, so too can He weaken strong
things like the mountains). Indeed He is Informed (fully
aware) of what you do (and will take you to task for the
wrong you do) " {Surah Naml, verse 88}.

This^2 is a fundamental aspect of belief and a necessary
element of all knowledge and recognition of Allaah’s
Oneness and Rabubiyyat. As Allaah says in His Book:
‘He created everything and Decreed it in a detailed way’.
And He also says: ‘Allaah’s Command is always a
decided Decree.’”
2). Because indeed Imaan is not straightened except with
recognition, and the basis of recognition is the acceptance
of the Oneness of Allaah Ta`ala. Towheed is not complete
except with the following two points:

The first point is Towheed in Khalq, i.e. there is creator
except Allaah Taala, and there is no shaper except Allaah. Also, Towheed in Rabwiyyah, i.e. there is no Rabb except Allaah Taala, and there is no benefactor or harmer except
Allaah.

The second point on Towheed is Amr, i.e. there is no
maker in the laws of Deen except Allaah Taala, there is no ruler/judge except Allaah, there is indeed no Command except from Allaah Taala. He has ordered that we worship
none but He.

Both of these aspects of Towheed cannot be recognised
except with belief in Taqdeer, in that there is none who
destines fate except Allaah Ta`ala. He is the One Who
created all the creation and He has chalked out their
respective fates. He is the One Who issues the Commands.
He has destined their lives and has stipulated their demises.
He has ordained the Shari'ah and has abrogated it as He
desired. Everything is recorded in The Book. He can efface
what He desires and confirm what He Wills. It is for this
reason that Sheikh !ا $%&ر repeats the issues of the creation and
Towheed. These are from amongst the basis of the Deen

and the principles of recognition. Hence he has also quoted
the two Aayaat, stated above.

***********************************************
******** “So woe to anyone who argues with Allaah
concerning the Decree and who, with a sick heart^1 , starts
delving into this matter. In his delusory attempt to
investigate the Unseen, he is seeking a secret that can
never be uncovered, and he ends up an evil-doer, telling
nothing but lies.”
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Is he who was dead (as a
Kaafir) , then We granted him life (guided him to Islaam)
and gave him a light (Imaan) by which he may walk
among people better than someone (a Kaafir) like him
who is in a multitude of darkness (kufr and sin) from
which he will not come out (who will die as a Kaafir)? "
{Surah An'aam, verse 122}. That is he was dead in disbelief and We
gave him the life of Imaan. Hence, a pure and believing
heart is a living heart. If falsehood and distasteful things
are presented before it, it naturally flees therefrom and
dislikes and hates it. It is not inclined towards it. Contrary
to a heart which is dead with kufr and deviation. This type
of heart cannot differentiate between good and evil, virtue
and sin. It, due to its weakness inclines towards whatever
is presented to it, in accordance to its sickness. There are
two types of sicknesses of the heart; sickness in
knowledge, this is the sickness of doubt; and the sickness
of actions which is the sickness of desires.

***********************************************
******** “Al-Arsh^1 (the Throne) and Al-Kursi^2 (the
Chair) are true, as Allaah had explained in The Qur`aan.
He is Independent^3 of the Throne and whatever is
beneath it. He encompasses^4 everything above it.”

“Al-Arsh^1 (the Throne)
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "(Allaah is) The Exalter of
ranks (the One Who raises our status) and the Owner of

the Throne" {Surah Mu'min, verse 15}. Allaah Ta`ala says: He is
the Most Forgiving, All Loving, Owner of the Throne, the
Majestic..." {Surah Burooj, verses 14-15}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "There is no Ilaah but Him. He is
the Rabb of the Glorious Throne" {Surah Mu'minoon, verse 116}.

The existence of the Throne is established from these
Aayaat, with varying qualities.

and Al-Kursi^2 (the Chair) are true, as Allaah had
explained in The Qur`aan.
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "His Kursi (throne) includes
the heavens and the earth (and whatever is within them)
and He never tires of caring for them. He is High (above
His creation) , The Tremendous (the Supreme) " {Surah Baqara,
verse 255}. Al-Kursi is like a stairs for the Arsh, that leads up
to the it. It has stages upon stages, as interpreted by Haafiz
Ibn Katheer ,ا -./ر in Al-Bidaayah Wan Nihaayah.

He is Independent^3 of the Throne and whatever is
beneath it.
3). Because He Υ is its Rabb and Owner, as He says:
"On Him only do I rely and He is the Rabb of the
glorious Throne " {Surah Taubah, verse 129}. The Rabb of anything
is not dependant on it, in fact He is independent of it. It
would be a clash of opposites if the Rabb (Nourisher) is
independent of the marboob (nourished) and that He is

dependant on it. This would be spurious. He has created it
so that He may, thereby, make known His Quality of
Ownership over it. The Arsh is a place wherefrom His
Orders and Plans are sent forth.

He encompasses^4 everything above it.”
4). As Allaah Taala says: **_"Behold! He Encompasses everything"_** {Surah HaaMeem Sajdah, verse 54}. This explanation has already passed. Also, the Arsh is like a dome upon the universe. It is as though it encompasses everything that is beneath it, and Allaah Taala Encompasses the Arsh and
everything that is above it and below it. The object of
encompassment is not like that of a ship and the creation is
within it. Allaah Ta`ala is much more superior than that.
He is Most High and Magnanimous. Indeed the object of
encompassment is a great and limitless encompassment.
His knowledge, His Power, His protection, His Planning
and Arrangement encompasses all. All the people and
particles of all the universes and worlds are subservient to
His Magnanimous Attributes, which expound His
Perfection. All this is attributed to His Greatness. An atom
cannot be compared to the entire universe.

“And what He has created is incapable^1 of encompassing
Him. We say^2 with belief, acceptance and submission
that Allaah took Ibraheem as an intimate friend and that
He spoke directly to Moosa^3. We believe^4 in the Angels,
and the Ambiyaa, and the Books which were revealed to
the Messengers.”

“And what He has created is incapable^1 of encompassing
Him.
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says : "while they are unable to
encompass (comprehend) His knowledge (they will never
be able to know all that Allaah knows) " {Surah TaaHaa, verse 110}.

He cannot be encompassed by knowledge, or power, or
action or planning. Also, it is not possible for the
Encompasser to be encompassed. This would be a case of
clashing of opposites.

We say^2 with belief, acceptance and submission that
Allaah took Ibraheem as an intimate friend
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says; "Allaah chose Ibraheem υυυυ
for a (sincere) friend " {Surah Nisaa, verse 125}. Sheikh mentions
this as a refutation to the Mu`tazilas and philosophers who
claim that affection and friendship (which is perfect
affection) cannot be achieved except with correlation
between the lover and the beloved, and there is no
correlation between the Ever-Living and the newly created.
This is a false and spurious claim. Logic and intelligence
refutes such a claim.

and that He spoke directly to Moosa^3.
3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah specially (directly)

spoke to Moosa υ " {Surah Nisaa, verse 164}.
The explanation of this passed in the discussion of the
Quraan being the Speech of Allaah Taala.

We believe^4 in the Angels, and the Ambiyaa, and the
Books which were revealed to the Messengers.”
4). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "The Rasool (Muhammad ε )
believed in that which has been revealed to him from his
Rabb and (so do) the Mu'mineen. Each one believes in
Allaah, His angels, His Books and His Rusul. (They say)
“We make no distinction between one and another
messenger" {Surah Baqara, verse 285}.

As Allaah Taala says: **_"Righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the east or west_** _(during salaah)_ **_, but_** _(a person of)_ **_righteousness is that person who believes in Allaah, the Last Day_** _(the Day of Qiyaamah)_ **_, the angels, the Books, and the Ambiyaa_** ا+*)م ,-./0 **_..."_** {Surah Baqara, verse 177}. Thus whosoever refutes this, he is according to the ruling of the Quraan a Kaafir and a deviate, who is
far from the Truth and Imaan. As Allaah Ta`ala says:
"Whoever disbelieves in Allaah, His angels, His Books,
His Rusul and the Last Day, then he has indeed
wandered far astray (regardless of the claims he makes) "
{Surah Nisaa, verse 136}. Also, that person who differentiates
between Allaah and His Ambiyaa ا$#"م '()*+, and he believes in
some and falsifies others, indeed such a person is also a
Kaafir and renegade of Islaam.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Indeed those who disbelieve in
(reject) Allaah and His Rusul, who seek to draw a
distinction between Allaah and His Rusul (by believing in
Allaah and not in His Rusul) , those who say, “We believe
in some (Rusul, as per their motives) and disbelieve in
some (as per their whims) ,” and who seek to adopt a path
between these (between Imaan and kufr) , such people are
true Kaafiroon. We have prepared for the Kaafiroon a
disgraceful punishment" {Surah Nisaa, verses 50-51}.

Hence the fundamentals of Imaan are seven: Belief
(Imaan) in Allaah Ta`ala, His Angels, His Messengers, His

revealed Kitaabs, the day of Qiyaamah, in Taqdeer and in
Jannah and Jahannam. Some of these are mentioned in the
text of the Kitaab and the explanation of the others have
passed. The philosophers refute all of them and have
obfuscated (confused) their meanings. They do not believe.

“And we bear witness that they were all following the
manifest Truth. We call^1 the people of our Qiblah
Muslims and believers as long as they acknowledge what
the Rasul ρρρρ brought, and accept as true everything that
he said and told us about.”
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Follow the religion of your

father Ibraheem υυυυ. It was He (Allaah) who named you
Muslims from before (in the previous scriptures) and in
this Qur’aan" {Surah Hajj, verse 78}. As Allaah Taala says from Hadhrat Ibraheem υ: **_“O our Rabb! Make us obedient to You and make from our descendants a nation that is also obedient to You"_** {Surah Baqara, verse 128}.The title of Muslims for this Ummat was from before its existence and will also be after its passing on, as is borne out by the text of the Quraan Majeed: " O you who have Imaan! Fear Allaah
as He should be feared (by obeying all His commands)
and do not die except as Muslims" {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 102}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Say, “We have Imaan in Allaah,
in that which was revealed to us, what was revealed to

Ibraheem υυυυ , Ismaa’eel υυυυ , Is’haaq υυυυ , Ya’qoob υυυυ , the
descendants (of Ya’qoob υ who were Ambiyaa) , and that
which was revealed to Moosa υυυυ , to Isa υυυυ and to all the
Ambiyaa from their Rabb. We make no distinction
between any of them (between any of the Ambiyaa by

believing in some and rejecting others) and to Him we are
Muslims (we have surrendered) ” {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 84}.

This has been expounded in a clear way by our Nabi, the
most truthful of the truthful (sallallahu alaihi wasallam):
“He who performs our Salaat (i.e. reads Salaat like us),
faces towards our Qiblah and eats our slaughtered
animals, is a Muslim.”

***********************************************
********

“We do not enter into vain talk^1 about Allaah.”
1). Because indeed to argue and enter into vain talk
about regarding the Being and Signs of Allaah Ta`ala are
the arguments of the hypocrites.

To make known one’s opinions without having knowledge
is not permissible.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah sends the bolts of
lightning to strike whoever He wills while they are
disputing about Allaah. Allaah is fiercely Powerful " {Surah
Ra'ad, verse 13}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Thus does Allaah allow those
people to go astray who transgress the limits and who are
sceptical, those who dispute about Allaah’s Aayaat
without any warrant (justification) coming to them" {Surah
Mu'min, verses 34-34}.

Hence it is not appropriate for anyone to discuss or speak
about the Being of Allaah Taala except with the Attributes that He has described Himself with. Therefore you will see that the quickest to dispute regarding Allaah Taala are the
people of desires and opinions and those who enter into

vain talk and play around regarding the Being of Allaah
Ta`ala, with their own cock-eyed opinions and thoughts.

“Nor do we allow any dispute^1 about the religion of
Allaah. We do not argue^2 about the Qur`aan and we bear
witness that it is the Speech of the Rabb of the worlds
which Hadhrat Jibraeel υ came down with.”

“Nor do we allow any dispute^1 about the religion of
Allaah.
1). That is the people of the Haqq do not allow
themselves to be led astray by the whisperings and ruses of
the people of desire. This would be like seeking a
judgement from false judges, and indeed we have been
ordered to reject the false judges. As Allaah Taala says: **_“And they wish to go for judgement to the Taghut (false judges) while they have been ordered to reject them”_** {Surah Nisaa, verse 60}. Also this is a ruse, deception and a cover-up of the Truth with falsehood. This is also forbidden. As Allaah Taala says regarding the Ahle Kitaab: "Do not
mix the Haqq (the truth, which I have revealed) with lies
(that you have invented) and do not knowingly
(intentionally) conceal the Haqq (the truth concerning the

Nabuwwaat of Muhammad ε ) " {Surah Baqara, verse 42}.
To argue regarding the Haqq is deceit. As Allaah Ta`ala
says regarding the Mushrikeen: "They (the Mushrikeen

then) say, “Are our gods (idols) better or he (Isa υ ) ?”
They say this to you only to dispute, for they are a people
given to arguing. (They realise that it is their idols that are
being referred to, but merely raise the objection to develop

an argument.) He (Hadhrat Isa υ ) is but a servant on
whom We have bestowed Our bounties (by making him
Our Rasool) , and whom We have made an example for
the Bani Israa’eel (and for mankind after them to prove to
them that Allaah can create without the apparent means) "
{Surah Zukhruf, verses 58-59}.

We do not argue^2 about the Qur`aan and we bear witness
that it is the Speech of the Rabb of the worlds which
Hadhrat Jibraeel υ came down with.”

2). That is, do say regarding the Quraan Majeed, its words, meanings or recital, as the deviates have said. Indeed the people of deviation have made it the pastime of their desires and opinion to change and alter the Kalaam of Allaah Taala. This they have done so as to plant seeds of
doubt in the Ahle Haqq. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "The
Kuffaar use falsehood (baseless and absurd arguments) to
dispute in order to eradicate the truth and they make a
mockery of My Aayaat and the warnings that have been
given to them" {Surah Kahaf, verse 56}.

Advice will not benefit them, in fact, the only solution for
them is -- The Sword! We should also not delve into
argument and vain talk with regard to the words and recital
of the Quraan Majeed. As Hadhrat Ibn Masood τ said: “I

heard a person reciting an Aayat which Nabi ρ recited
differently. I went with him to Nabi ρ and told him about
his recital. I noticed in his (sallallahu alaihi wasallam)’s
face distaste. He said; ‘Nay! Do it (in the way that is)
beautiful, and no not differ, indeed those who were before
you were destroyed because they differed.’” If we are not
allowed to dispute with the Ahle Kitaab except in a good
way, then all the more should we not argue with the people
of Imaan. If a believer falters, we must not brand him a
kaafir unless a definite proof does not surface. As Nabi ρ

said: “Allaah Ta`ala has raised (forgiven/overlooked) from
this Ummat mistakes and forgetfulness.”

“And taught^1 the Most Honoured of all the Messengers,
Muhammad ρρρρ. It is the Speech^2 of Allaah and no speech

“And taught^1 the Most Honoured of all the Messengers,
Muhammad ρρρρ.
1). This is a declaration of Hadhrat Jibraeel’s υ teaching
Nabi ρ. This is a refutation of what some deviates like the
sect Qaraamitah and others claim that the Quraan was imbibed directly into the heart of Nabi ρ , by way of envisaging and imagining. This claim of theirs is a refutation of the concept of Wahi from Allaah Taala. May
Allaah Ta`ala save us from us corrupt beliefs.

It is the Speech^2 of Allaah and no speech of any created
being is comparable to it.”
2). Allaah Ta`ala says: "Say, “If mankind and the Jinn
combine to (try to) produce something similar to this
Qur’aan, they would not be able to produce anything like
it even if they assistant each other” {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 88}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Or do they (the Kuffaar) say, “He

(Rasulullaah ρ ) has fabricated (forged) it (the Qur'aan). ”
Say, “Produce ten ‘fabricated’ (in your words) Surahs
like any in it (in the Qur'aan) and, besides Allaah, call

whoever you can (to assist you) if you are truthful (in
your claim) ” {Surah Hood, verse 13}.

Then the Aayat was revealed: "If you are in doubt about
what We have revealed to Our bondsman (if you doubt

that the Qur'aan which was revealed to Muhammad ε is
from Allaah) , then produce even a single Surah like any
in the Qur'aan (something that can match the eloquence,
the beauty, the style and the prophecies of the Qur'aan).
And (you are also at liberty to) call your witnesses (your
helpers and deities) besides Allaah if you are truthful
(stand up to this challenge if you feel that you are truthful

in your claim that Muhammad ε was the author of the
Qur'aan. If your claim is correct, you will easily be able to
compose something equal if not superior because

Muhammad ε was an untutored person) " {Surah Baqara, verse 23}.
Then the Aayat was revealed: "Do they (the Mushrikeen)

say that he (Rasulullaah ρ ) fabricated it (the Qur'aan)?
Tell them, “Then produce even a single Surah like any in
it (in the Qur'aan) (something that can match the
eloquence, the beauty, the style and the prophecies of the
Qur'aan) and (you are also at liberty to) call whoever you
can (to assist you) besides Allaah if you are truthful"
{Surah Yunus, verse 38}.

The summary of this is that any non-Mujizah is unlike a Mujizah. Absolutely no speech can be comparable to the
Quraan Majeed. In fact, any Speech of Allaah Taala’s
cannever be compared to that of man’s. Speech is the
translation or rendition of knowledge, and the Knowledge
of Allaah Taala’s is All-Encompassing and the knowledge of man is encompassed. The encompassed cannot leave the perimeters of its encompassment, which is the Knowledge of Allaah Taala. Notwithstanding this, the speech of man

is a creation of Allaah Ta`ala. How can a limited creation
ever compare to an All-Encompassing Creator? This would
then be a case of contradictory opposites.

“We do not say that it was created and we do not go
against^1 the Jamaa`ah of the Muslims regarding it.”
1). Commentary on this subject that the Quraan Majeed is the uncreated Speech of Allaah Taala has passed in
great detail. The Author ,ا -./ر, by saying that we do not go
against the Jamaaah of the Muslims is indicating that anyone who avers that the Quraan is a creation of Allaah
Taala, he is in fact opposing the Jamaaah of the Muslims.
All the Salaf-e-Saaliheen (pious predecessors) have agreed
that the Speech of Allaah Taala is uncreated. During the era of Khalifah Mamoon, the Ulama and people of Haqq
bore untold hardships and punishments due to their
refutation of the claim that the Quraan is created. They underwent great difficulties, but they remained steadfast, and maintained all along that the Quraan Majeed is the
Speech of Allaah Ta`ala and uncreated.

“We do not consider any of the people of our Qiblah to be
unbelievers^1 because of any wrong action they have
done, as long as they do not consider that action to have
been lawful^2. Nor do we say^3 that the wrong action of a
man who has belief does not have a harmful effect on
him.”

“We do not consider any of the people of our Qiblah to be
unbelievers^1 because of any wrong action they have
done,

1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "O you who have Imaan!
Qisaas has been made obligatory (has been ordained) for
you in the case of murder; a free man (will be executed)
for (murdering) a free man, a slave for a slave and a
woman for a woman. Whoever (heir) forgives his brother
(the murderer), should demand (the Diyah) with kindness
(without harshness) and payment should be pleasant
(without delay and in full). This (choice between Qisaas
and Diyah) is a special consideration from your Rabb and
a mercy (because the Jews were compelled to apply Qisaas
when a murder was committed and the Christians were
compelled to accept Diyah instead). So whoever oversteps
the limits (by killing the murderer) after this (after the
murderer was forgiven) shall suffer a painful punishment
(by being executed in this world and punished in the
Aakhirah) " {Surah Baqara, verse 178}.

A (Muslim) murderer is not excluded from those who have
Imaan, notwithstanding the sin of his of murdering
someone without any right or valid reason to do so. The
brotherhood of Deen still holds firm. It is thus established
that even after the gravest of the grave sins, i.e. murder, a
person still remains a Muslim and a brother of the
believers. As Allaah Ta`ala says: If two groups of
Mu'mineen fight each other, then reconcile between
them. (However, despite your efforts to reconcile,) If the
one group transgresses against (oppresses) the other,
then fight that (transgressing) group until they return to
(the obedience of) Allaah’s command (to live in peace and
harmony with other Muslims). If they return (to the
reconciliation process and stop fighting) , then reconcile

between them with justice. Be just, for Allaah loves those
who exercise justice. The Mu'mineen are all brothers
(because they all belong to the same Deen) , so reconcile
(create harmony) between your brothers (whenever a
dispute arises). Fear Allaah so that mercy may be shown
to you. {Surah Hujuraat, verses 9-10}.

It is confirmed here also that Allaah Taala does not declare a Muslim murderer a kaafir, and counts him among the believers and among the brotherhood of Islaam. This is a refutation of the Khawaarij, who declare as kaafir all sinners. They contradict the Quraan Majeed.

as long as they do not consider that action to have been
lawful^2.
2). Indeed to regard as Halaal something which the
Shari'ah has rejected, is destructive to the Aqeedah (belief).
This is kufr. Committing a sin, whilst having one’s
Aqeedah intact, (i.e. not condoning or regarding as
permissible the sin), is fisq and not kufr.

Nor do we say^3 that the wrong action of a man who has
belief does not have a harmful effect on him.”
3). This is a refutation of the Murjiyah sect, who aver
that Imaan is unaffected by sin, just as obedience is
unaffected by kufr. These people are on the extreme in
their beliefs and the Mutazilas are on the other extreme, since they aver that Imaan does not remain after sin. They damn as kaafir every sinning Muslim. The truth is that sin does affect the believer, but his Imaan remains intact. The texts of the Quraan and Ahaadith bear out that every
person who had even an atom’s weight of Imaan in his
heart will eventually be saved from the Fire. That is, a

sinning believer will be in the Fire (albeit for a limited
time), as a believer. The sin of a believer will harm him in
that it will warrant his entry into the Fire. The various
Aayaat of Shafaa`at (intercession) prove that the sin of
believers will harm them, although they will still remain
believers, because intercession will not be permissible for
kuffaar.

Obedience with kufr will also be of no benefit. Take the
example of Abu Taalib, who will remain in the Fire
forever, due to his kufr and rejection of Imaan.
Nevertheless, his punishment will not be of a very severe
nature, owing to his assisting and aiding Nabi ρ throughout
his life.

“We hope that Allaah Ta`ala will pardon^1 people of right
action among the believers and grant them entry into

“We hope that Allaah Taala will pardon_**^1 **_people of right action among the believers and grant them entry into Jannah through His Mercy,_** _1). As Allaah Taala says: "(O mankind!) The

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Verily Allaah is Most Pardoning,
Most Forgiving" {Surah Hajj, verse 60}. Divine Pardon and

Forgiveness is for the sinners from amongst the believers
and not for the polytheists, kuffaar and hypocrites. As
Allaah Ta`ala says: "Verily Allaah does not forgive that
Shirk (and kufr) be committed, but may forgive all (sins)
besides this for whom He wills. Whoever commits Shirk
has indeed invented a terrible sin" {Surah Nisaa, verse 48}.

As Allaah says: "Allaah promises the fire of Jahannam
for the hypocrite men, the hypocrite women and the
Kuffaar. They shall live there forever. It is sufficient (as
punishment) for them. Allaah has cursed them and they
shall suffer an everlasting punishment" {Surah Taubah, verse 68}.

but we cannot^2 be certain of this.”
2). This is due to our not having any knowledge of the
unseen and internal conditions. As Allaah Ta`ala says:
"Are they secure from Allaah’s plan (punishment)? Only
those at a loss feel secure from Allaah’s plan" {Surah A'raaf,
verse 99}

Al-Makr refers to hidden plans. We are unaware of them so
how can we have faith in it? Yes we have hope that Allaah
accepts the good actions and virtuous acts. As Allaah
Taala says: **_"but_** _(Allaah)_ **_may forgive all_** _(sins)_ **_besides_** _(Shirk)_ **_this for whom He wills "_** {Surah Nisaa, verse 48}. As has passed, the Forgiveness of Allaah Taala is dependent on
His Desire and Will. We have absolutely no knowledge of
the Will and Desire of Allaah Taala. So how can we ever be content and snug with this belief that Allaah Taala will
forgive anyone? In fact, we have no surety of the
acceptance of the forgiver after he has made sincere
repentance after committing a sin.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "There are others who admit their
sins (acknowledge that they were wrong). They have

mixed their actions, some being good (the previous
expeditions that they joined) , while others are evil (the
expedition that they missed without valid reasons). Allaah
will soon accept their repentance (and forgive them).
Allaah is certainly Most Forgiving, Most Merciful" {Surah
Taubah, verse 102}.

Since we have no certainty of the acceptance of Taubah in
this world, how can we ever be certain about it (have faith
in it)? Yes, we have good thoughts and hopes in Allaah
Taala, and in the sincerity of the repenters, and we have hope in the Mercy of Allaah Taala.

“And we cannot bear witness^1 that it will definitely
happen and that they will be in Jannah.”
That is, for any one person with certainty and
conviction, that he is from the inmates of Jannah or
Jahannam, due to our lack of knowledge in this sphere. As
Allaah Ta`ala says:
And do not pursue what you have no knowledge about
(do not comment on subjects you have no knowledge about
or speak about something that has not been verified).
Indeed questioning (on the Day of Qiyaamah) shall take
place with regard to (what) the ears (heard) , (what) the
eyes (saw) and (what thoughts and wrong beliefs) the
hearts (harboured) " {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 36}.
As Nabi ρ said to Hadhrat Aishah 1(2+ ,ر34 ا on the occasion of
the demise of an Ansaar child: “Glad tidings to that bird
from amongst the birds of Jannah” etc. “O Aishah! Allaah
is All-Aware of what they do.”

That is, it is not appropriate or correct for us to certify
Jannah for any particular person, with conviction.
Similarly, with the Fire or acceptance of Taubah. As is
mentioned in a Hadith of Nabi ρ regarding two men from
the Bani Israeel. One of them used to sin and the other
strive in Ibaadat. The worshipper always saw the other
involved in sin. He used to tell him: “Cut down! (on your
sinning)” one day he saw him involved in a sin and he told
him to cut down. The sinner told him: “Leave me alone! I
take an oath in Allaah’s Name, were you sent as a mentor
over me?” The other replied: “I take an oath on Allaah’s
Name! Allaah will never forgive you” Or he said “Allaah
will never enter you into Jannah.” When the two of them
passed away, their souls were presented before Allaah
Taala, Who said to the worshipper: _“Were you more knowing that I?”_ Or He said: _“Do you have control over My Hand?”_ Allaah Taala told the sinner: “Go and enter
into Jannah through My Mercy.” And He said regarding
the worshipper: “Take him to the Fire.” [Mishkaat].

Hence it is not permissible for us to rule in favour of any
particular person with regard to his being successful or
unsuccessful, of is entering Jannah or Jahannam. Indeed it
is possible that a particular sinner (in our eyes) is actually
one who strives in mistake and is forgiven by Allaah Υ.
How can we ever rule against his forgiveness, when the
opposite is possible. There are at least ten possibilities that
can remove entrance into the Fire for any slave; Taubah,
repentance, good deeds, difficulties in the world,
conditions in the grave, conditions on the Day of
Resurrection, the dua of the believers for their brothers, the
intercession of the intercessors, and the mercy and
Forgiveness of the Most Merciful. We have no knowledge
of the acceptance or application of any of these

possibilities, hence we cannot condemn anyone with
certainty to the Fire or towards destruction.

“We ask forgiveness^1 for the people of wrong action
among the believers and, although we are afraid^2 for
them, we are not in despair^3 about them.”
“We ask forgiveness^1 for the people of wrong action
among the believers and,
1). As Allaah Ta`ala taught us to make Astaghfaar for
the deceased, He says: “O our Rabb! Forgive us and our
brothers who passed before us with Imaan. And do not
place any impurity (ill-feelings) in our hearts against
those who have Imaan. O our Rabb! Indeed You are the
Most Forgiving, Most Merciful” {Surah Hashar, verse 10}.

although we are afraid^2 for them,
2). Because of the possibility of their Taubah and
repentance not being accepted by Allaah Ta`ala. Indeed
this is a matter of the unseen and unknown. We have no
knowledge about it, hence it is not for us except to have
hope in His Mercy and fear His Punishment. We do not
decree with any certainty.

we are not in despair^3 about them.”
3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: “O My bondsmen who have
wronged their souls (by committing kufr or other sins)!
Never lose hope of Allaah’s mercy (so do not abstain from
seeking forgiveness thinking that you will not be forgiven).
Verily, Allaah forgives all sins (that are free of kufr and

Shirk). Undoubtedly, He is the Most Forgiving, the Most
Merciful” {Surah Zumar, verse 53}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "And do not become despondent
of Allaah’s mercy. Indeed only the nation that commits
kufr grows despondent (loses hope) of Allaah’s mercy”
{Surah Yusuf, verse 87}.

***********************************************
********

“Certainty^1 and despair both remove one from the
religion, but the path of truth for the people of the Qiblah
lies between the two.”

1). That is, certainty is from amongst the Plans
(specialities) of Allaah Taala. To have only hope is not from our religion, unless there is fear coupled with it. Just like to have fear only and to despair are not from our religion, until there is hope coupled with it. **Hence, Imaan is suspended between hope and fear.** The hope that is desired from us is the one which has fear integrated with it. If it is not like this then one will be in certainty. The fear that is desired from us must have hope coupled with it. If it is not like this then it will be despair and despondency. Thus to negate certainty is to negate hope only. As Allaah Taala says: "Are they secure from Allaah’s plan
(punishment)? Only those at a loss feel secure from
Allaah’s plan" {Surah A'raaf, verse 99}

To negate despondency is to negate fear altogether, as
Allaah Ta`ala says: "And do not become despondent of
Allaah’s mercy. Indeed only the nation that commits kufr
grows despondent (loses hope) of Allaah’s mercy” {Surah
Yusuf, verse 87}.

A Mu’min is one who combines the two – neither is he one
who is only certain nor is he always despondent. Allaah
Ta`ala combines these two for the believers when He says:
"Those (gods) that the Mushrikeen call upon (whom they

worship, such as Nabi Isa υ and the angels) also seek a
means to approach their Rabb, (vying with each other to
see) who of them shall be closest and they (also) aspire
for His mercy while fearing His punishment (How can
they be worshipped when they themselves worship
Allaah?). (Therefore, worship Allaah Only and forsake all
gods because) The punishment of your Rabb (for those
who commit Shirk) is frightening indeed" {Surah Bani Israa'eel,
verse 57}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: Their sides part from their beds
(they wake up for Tahajjud salaah) , they make du’aa to
their Rabb in fear (for His punishment) and (having)
hope (in His mercy) " {Surah Sajdah, verse 16}.

Allaah Ta`ala has praised those who combine hope and
fear, when He says: " (Is this Kaafir better) Or the person
who is engrossed in (Allaah’s) worship throughout the
hours of the night, prostrating and standing, fearing the
Aakhirah and hoping for the mercy of his Rabb?" {Surah
Zumar, verse 9}.

The reality is that indeed it is Allaah Ta`ala Who is The
Owner of Majesty and Benevolence, as He says: "Blessed
is the name of your Rabb, the Possessor of majesty and
benevolence" {Surah Rahmaan, verse 78}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: " (Allaah announces) Inform My
bondsmen that I am certainly the Most Forgiving, the
Most Merciful (I shall forgive all sins when My bondsman

repents sincerely) and (inform them also) that (they should
not let Shaytaan deceive them into thinking that they can
continue sinning and repent later because) My
punishment is definitely a most painful punishment (and
they should never risk suffering My punishment) " {Surah Hijr,
verses 49-50}.

Hence, a necessity for the Mercy of Allaah is to have hope,
and fear is a necessity for punishment. When Imaan is
suspended between these two qualities, then the fruits
thereof will be that Imaan will not consist of merely hope
only or fear only.

“A person does not step out^1 of belief except by
disavowing what brought him into it. Belief (Imaan)^2
consists of affirmation by the tongue and acceptance by
the heart.”
“A person does not step out^1 of belief except by
disavowing what brought him into it.
1). This is a refutation of the averment of the Khawaarij
and Mutazilas, who claim the committer of major sins is a kaafir. Hence the first lot enter him (committer of major sins) in to kufr after removing him from Imaan and the latter (Mutazilas) remove him from Imaan, but they do not
rule kufr upon him, rather they claim that he is in a stage
between the two stages. The Ahle-Haqq do not accept this
stage between the two stages. The heart is either firm on
belief or refutes, as Allaah Ta`ala says: "It is He Who
created you, (and showed you the paths of Imaan and kufr)
so among you are Mu'mineen and among you are

Kaafiroon. Allaah is Watchful over what you do (and will
take you to task for the wrong you do) " {Surah Taghaabun, verse 2}.

There is no midway between the two; a Mumin is one who have belief. Allaah Taala describes the Aimmah of
Hidayat who have total Imaan, thus: "...and were
convinced about (the truth of) Our Aayaat" {Surah Sajdah, verse
24}. The Kaafir are those who refute belief. Allaah Taala describes the refuters with kufr, He says: **_"It is only the_** _(die-hard)_ **_Kaafiroon who reject Our Aayaat"_** {Surah Ankaboot, verse 47}. The doubters and those who conceal kufr whilst they display Imaan are amongst the Kaafireen. This is so because indeed, doubt and uncertainty and reservations (in belief) and to hide kufr under the guise of Imaan (the hypocrites) – all these are Kaafir, because they contradict Imaan and belief. There is no stage between kufr and Imaan, which is borne out by the Aayat: **_“Thus amongst you are kaafir and amongst you are Mumin”_** {Surah
Taghaabun, verse 2}. Hence, the Math-hab of the Ahlus Sunnah is
that we do not label as kaafir any person of our Qiblah, by
the mere committing of sins, unless he does not make that
sin Halaal and he does not refute Imaan. Explanation on
this has passed.

Belief (Imaan)^2 consists of affirmation by the tongue and
acceptance by the heart.”

2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Say, “We have Imaan in
Allaah, in that which was revealed to us, what was

revealed to Ibraheem υυυυ , Ismaa’eel υυυυ , Is’haaq υυυυ , Ya’qoob
υυυυ , the descendants (of Ya’qoob υ who were Ambiyaa) , and
that which was revealed to Moosa υυυυ , to Isa υυυυ and to all
the Ambiyaa from their Rabb” {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 84}.

Also, to say with the tongue is a form of testification, and
testification is from amongst the fundamentals of Islaam,
as is borne out by the Hadith of Hadhrat Ibn Umar τ who
reports from Nabi ρ: “Islaam is based upon five things –
testification that indeed there is no deity but Allaah and

that Muhammad ρ is the Rasool of Allaah.” Testification
with the tongue is also from amongst the requisites of
Imaan and it is an ordered thing, so that one’s Imaan may
become manifest. Hence the source and base of Imaan is
the heart, and the tongue is the interpreter thereof in this
world. The tongue is not the actual source and base of
Imaan.

“And the whole^1 of what Allaah has revealed in the
Qur`aan, and the whole^2 of what is proven from the
Rasul ρρρρ , regarding the Shari'ah and the explanation (of
the Qur`aan and of Islaam) is true.”
“And the whole^1 of what Allaah has revealed in the
Qur`aan,
1). This is clear, since the Quraan Majeed is a definitive and final proof and Wahi from Allaah Taala. This is a
definite and undisputed truth. Baatil cannot enter into it
either from the front or the back. This is the revelation
from the All Wise, All Praiseworthy. There is absolutely
no doubt in it, as Allaah Taala says: **_There is no doubt_** _(or error)_ **_in this Book"_** {Surah Baqara, verse 2}. Refutation of it is not permissible, as Allaah Taala says: "This (Qur'aan) is a
blessed advice that We have revealed. Will you then reject
it?" {Surah Ambiyaa, verse 50}.

and the whole^2 of what is proven from the Rasul ρρρρ ,
regarding the Shari'ah and the explanation (of the
Qur`aan and of Islaam) is true.”
2). Indeed this is Wahi (Divine Revelation) from Allaah
Taala, even though it is not recitable. Regarding whatever has been proven by Nabi ρ, there are two types: The original code of Islamic law, and the explanation of whatever has been revealed by Allaah Taala in His Kitaab
(Quraan Majeed). - all this is Haqq and it is Waajib (compulsory) to follow it. In this, Sheikh ,ا -./ر is indicating and implying the authenticity and acceptance as proof of the Ahaadith, thereby refuting the claims of the rejecters of the Ahaadith, like the Jahmiyahs, Muattalas, Mutazilas, Rawafidh and the other minority deviant sects of this era. Thus theses people have plugged darkness upon the hearts for the recognition of Allaah Taala, His Names,
Attributes, and Actions, which are expounded by Nabi ρ.
They have removed the speech of Nabi ρ and have given
way to their own conjectures and opinions. They are like to
a thirsty person who sees a mirage from far and when he
gets there he finds nothing besides Allaah Ta`ala.

A strange thing is that these people have given preference
to their own ‘proofs’ over Wahi. They will be unsuccessful
in this world and Aakhirah. They are in clear deviation.
The method of the Ahlus Sunnah is that we do not
transgress the authentic texts of Nabi ρ and we do not
contradict it with our own whims and fancies, because
indeed the texts from Nabi ρ are also proofs in the
Shari'ah, and it comprises explanations of the Quraan Majeed. As Allaah Taala says: We have revealed the

Reminder (the Qur’aan) to you (O Muhammad ε ) so that
you may explain to the people what (injunctions of the
Shari'ah) has been revealed to them, and so that they may
reflect (carefully) " {Surah Nahl, verse 44}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Hold fast to what (commands) the

Rasool ρρρρ gives you and refrain from what (actions) He
prevents you (because whatever he instructs you is from
Allaah) " {Surah Hashar, verse 7}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "As for those who have Imaan,
who do righteous deeds and who believe in what has been

revealed to Muhammad εεεε , which is the truth from their
Rabb, Allaah will cancel their sins and rectify their
affairs (by giving them the ability to do more good in this
world and by granting them Jannah in the Aakhirah) " {Surah
Muhammad ρ, verse 2}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: " It is not (proper) for any Mu'min
man or woman to exercise any choice in their affairs
(contrary to Allaah’s commands) when Allaah and His
messenger have (already) decided a matter (and issued
clear commands concerning the particular matter). The

one who disobeys Allaah and His Rasool ρρρρ has certainly
deviated in a clear manner" {Surah Ahzaab, verse 36}.

“Belief^1 is, at base, the same for everyone, but the
superiority of some over others in it is due to their fear
and awareness of Allaah, their opposition to their desires,
and their choosing what is more pleasing to Allaah.”

1). Imaan is the same for all believers. They are all equal
in so far as being believers. However there are different

types and categories of believers. This is due to the
different rankings and stages of their Imaan. Taqwa,
opposition to desires and choosing what is more pleasing
to Allaah Ta`ala are the determining factors in
differentiating the levels of Imaan.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Thereafter (after revealing the

Qur'aan to Rasulullaah ρ ) , We made those of Our
bondsmen whom We chose (the Mu'mineen) inheritors of
the Book (the Qur'aan). Of them were those who
oppressed their souls (by committing sins) , while there
were those who were moderate (who neither sinned, nor
did more than the Faraa’idh and Waajibaat). There were
also those who were leaders in good deeds by the
command of their Rabb (those who refrained from sin and
besides the Faraa’idh and Waajibaat, also excelled in
performing optional good deeds). This (revelation of the
Qur'aan to mankind) is Allaah’s extreme grace" {Surah Faatir,
verse 32}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Say, “Can those with (spiritual)
knowledge be equal to those who do not have knowledge?
Only those with (spiritual) intelligence will heed (good
advice) ” {Surah Zumar, verse 9}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah shall elevate the
Mu'mineen among you and those given knowledge (of
Deen) by many ranks (degrees, stages) " {Surah Mujaadala, verse
11}.

That is, Imaan is one but the degrees and stages of the
believers are different. Just like how existence is one but
there are numerous things in existence. And like how the
light of the sun is one, but the illuminated things are many.

***********************************************
********
“All believers are ‘friends’^1 of Allaah and the noblest of
them in the Sight of Allaah are those who are the most
obedient and who most closely follow the Qur`aan.”
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah is the Protecting
Friend of those who have Imaan, bringing them from the
multitude of darkness (kufr, Shirk, falsehood) into the
light (Islaam, the truth). As for those who commit kufr,
their friends are the Shayaateen, who bring them out of
the light (of Imaan if they ever enter it) and (take them
back) into the multitude of darkness (kufr, Shirk). These
are the people of the Fire, where they shall live forever"
{Surah Baqara, verse 257}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Your Protecting Friend is only

Allaah, His Rasool εεεε and the Mu'mineen who establish
salaah, pay zakaah and who bow in Ruku. Whoever

befriends Allaah, His Rasool εεεε and the Mu'mineen
(instead of befriending the Kuffaar) , then indeed only the
party of Allaah (those with Him) shall be victorious (in
both worlds) " {Surah Maa'idah, verse 55,56}.

From this Aayat also, the brotherhood of the believers has
been established. Indeed they are all the ‘friends’ of Allaah
and Allaah is their ‘Friend’ and Protector. Indeed Allaah
befriends His believing slaves. He Loves them and they
love Him. He is Pleased with them and they are pleased
with Him. Whosoever opposes any friend of His, indeed he
is declaring war on Allaah. Thus Wilaayat (friendship) is
established by the statement “Friends of Allaah”. It is also
similar to Imaan in that it can be perfect or defective.
Sheikh ,ا -./ر is saying that the people of Wilaayat are the

same, in essence. And just like the people of Imaan, whose
actual Imaan is the same, but some are perfect and others
are defective. Just like how Imaan is perfect for the
Muttaqeen and defective for the rest of the common
believers. Wilaayat also has stages and levels just like that
of believers ---- Levels and stages which are determined
by fear of Allaah Taala and Taqwa. Hence, the Muminoonal Muttaqoon (pious believers), are those who
are the most obedient to Allaah Taala, and they are those who follow the Quraan and they are the most honoured in
the Sight of Allaah Ta`ala, both, in this world and in the
Hereafter, owing to their complete and perfect Wilaayat.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Behold! Verily for the friends of
Allaah there shall be no fear (about the future) , nor shall
they grieve (about their past). (The friends of Allaah are)
Those who have Imaan and who adopt Taqwa (they do
what Allaah commands and refrain from what He
prohibits). For them shall be good news in the life of this
world (the good news at the time of death that they will be
taken to Jannah) and in the Aakhirah (when they will
enter Jannah). There is nothing that can change the
words (decrees and promises) of Allaah. This (success of
Allaah’s friends) is the greatest success" {Surah Yunus, verses 62-
64}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: Verily, the most honoured of you
in Allaah’s sight is the one with the most Taqwa. Allaah
is certainly All Knowing, Informed (Only He knows whose
Taqwa is best) " {Surah Hujuraat, verse 13}.

It is recorded in the Sunan from Nabi ρ, who said: “The
Arab is not more virtuous than the non-Arab, nor is the
non-Arab more virtuous than the Arab. The white is not
more virtuous than the black, nor is the black more

virtuous than the white, except by (virtue of) Taqwa. All of
man are from Aadam and Aadam is from sand.” The
general believers are those who mix virtuous deeds with
evil deeds. They are defective in their Wilaayat and Imaan.
Then there are others who cover their Imaan with
oppression, shirk and kufr, and many of them do not even
believe in Allaah, they are the mushrikeen. Indeed all types
of obedience are branches of Imaan, and all types of
disobedience are branches of kufr. The fountainhead of
kufr is refutation (of Imaan) and the fountainhead of Imaan
is acceptance (of Imaan). It is possible that a person not be
a kaafir, but he executes acts of kufr and similarly, a
person who is not a believer, but he executes some of the
acts of Imaan. Hence the title of kaafir is placed upon him
after his refutation (of Imaan) and the title of believer is
placed on him after his acceptance.

When some misfortune befalls them they say, “This is

the Ambiyaa from their Rabb. We make no distinction
between any of them (between any of the Ambiyaa by
believing in some and rejecting others) and to Him we are
Muslims (we have surrendered) ” {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 84}.

The crux is that we do not differentiate between any of the
Ambiyaa in Imaan, in that we believe in some of them and
refute others.

In fact we believe in all of them. We accept all of them as
true. Hence, he who believes in some Ambiyaa and refutes
others and makes this his way, he is an absolute kaafir,
because indeed all the Ambiyaa came with the same true
message from Allaah Ta`ala. To refute one of them is to
refute all of them. Hence, he who after refuting some
Ambiyaa still deems himself a believer is from the losers.
His actions are all lost and of no avail, neither in this world
nor in the Hereafter. He thinks himself of doing good
deeds, but on the Day of Qiyaamah his scales will be
weightless.

“The grave sinners^1 ”
1). Al-Kabeerah are those sins upon which a Hadd
(punishment) has been stipulated and those which have
been warned with the Fire, Curse and Anger of Allaah
Ta`ala. They are sins such as murder, zina, black magic,

false accusation of pious, unwary, believing women, etc.
And like devouring the wealth of orphans, and interest,
disobedience to parents, false promises, false testifications,
etc. They are all such punishments which have been given
a severe warning of specific punishments in the Hereafter,
and also in this world, like Hadd and Qisaas.

As-Sagheerah (minor sins) are those which have no Hadd
stipulated for them for any specific punishments, except
that the rectification thereof is left to the Imaam of the
Muslims.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: " If you avoid the major sins you
are forbidden from (those sins for which punishment, a
penalty or a curse has been mentioned) , We shall wipe out
(forgive) your evil actions (minor sins) and enter you into
a place of honour (Jannah) " {Surah Nisaa, verse 31}.

sin and every sin which he repents from is a minor sin.

But not forever^2 , provided they die and meet Allaah as

“From the Ummat^1 of Muhammad ρρρρ will be in the Fire.
1). It is understood from this specification that the
people who committed major sins from the Ummats other
than the Ummat of Nabi ρ, prior to their Shari'ahs being
abrogated, are all excluded from this ruling, i.e. they will

all be in the Fire forever. Nevertheless, we will have to
reflect upon this – because Nabi ρ said: “That person who
has even an atom’s weight of Imaan in his heart will be
taken out from the Fire.” He (sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
did not specify his Ummat, in this statement, in fact, he
mentioned Imaan in general, without any exclusion of one
Ummat over any other.

But not forever^2 , provided they die and meet Allaah as

This is a clear refutation to the averment of the Khawaarij and the Mutazilas who claim that the people of Kabaair will remain forever in the Fire. However, the Khawaarij say that these (Ahle Kabaair) are kaafir and the Mutazilas say that they are without Imaan, but they have not included them amongst the kaafir. They (Mutazilas) claim that they
(Ahle Kabaa`ir) are in level between the two levels (of
Imaan and kufr), as has been explained.

3). Indeed if they are repenters, then there is no question
that Taubah effaces sins, as Allaah Ta`ala says: " (This
punishment is for all such people) Except for those who
(sincerely) repent, accept Imaan and perform good
actions. For such people Allaah will convert their sins
into good deeds. Allaah is Ever Most Forgiving, Most
Merciful" {Surah Furqaan, verse 70}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah accepts the repentance
only of those who carry out evil because of foolishness
(ignorance or naivety) and then (sincerely) repent soon
afterwards (before the pangs of death grip them). These
are the ones whom Allaah forgives. Allaah is All
Knowing, The Wise" {Surah Nisaa, verse 17}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: “O My bondsmen who have
wronged their souls (by committing kufr or other sins)!
Never lose hope of Allaah’s mercy (so do not abstain from
seeking forgiveness thinking that you will not be forgiven).
Verily, Allaah forgives all sins (that are free of kufr and
Shirk). Undoubtedly, He is the Most Forgiving, the Most
Merciful” {Surah Zumar, verse 53}.

As Nabi ρ said: “He who repents from a sin is like one
who has never sinned.”

“After they meet Allaah Ta`ala as recognisers^1. They are
subject to His Will and Judgement. If He wants, he will
forgive them and pardon them out of His Generosity. As
is mentioned in the Qur`aan when He says: ‘And He
forgives anything less than that (shirk) to whoever He
Wills.’. And if he wants, He will punish them in the Fire,
out of His Justice and then bring them out of the fire
through His Mercy, and for the intercession of those who
were obedient to Him, and send them to Jannah, this is
because Allaah is the Protector^2 of those who recognise
Him and will not treat them in the Next World in the
same way as He treats those who deny Him and who are
bereft of His Guidance and have failed to obtain His
Protection. O Allaah!^3 You are the Protector of Islaam
and its people.”
“After they meet Allaah Ta`ala as recognisers^1.
1). That is, the believers. Even if recognition is
complete, it will not be a means of one’s saviour without
Imaan. Indeed Iblees fully recognised His Rabb and His
Status, when he said: “O my Rabb, grant me respite until
the Day when people are resurrected” {Surah Saad, verse 79}. He
recognised the Honour and Greatness of Allaah Ta`ala. He
also recognised the protection of Allaah over His servants,
when he said: “By Your Honour, I will most certainly
lead them astray, all of them except Your chosen slves
amongst them” {Surah Saad, verses 82-83}. Because he did not
bring Imaan, he was unsuccessful, just like Firoun.

They are subject to His Will and Judgement. If He wants,
he will forgive them and pardon them out of His
Generosity. As is mentioned in the Qur`aan when He
says: ‘And He forgives anything less than that (shirk) to
whoever He Wills.’. And if he wants, He will punish them
in the Fire, out of His Justice and then bring them out of
the fire through His Mercy, and for the intercession of
those who were obedient to Him, and send them to
Jannah, this is because Allaah is the Protector^2 of those
who recognise Him and will not treat them in the Next
World in the same way as He treats those who deny Him
and who are bereft of His Guidance and have failed to
obtain His Protection.

2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "This is because Allaah is
the Protecting Friend of the Mu'mineen and because the
Kaafiroon have no protecting friend" {Surah Muhammad ρ, verse
11}.

O Allaah!^3 You are the Protector of Islaam and its
people.”
3). This is from the dua of Nabi ρ. The sentence ends
upon this dua, owing to the appropriateness of the
occasion, and this is quite clear.

“Make us firm in Islaam until the Day we meet You^1. We
agree with doing Salaat^2 behind any of the people of the
Qiblah whether right-acting or wrong-acting, and doing
the funeral prayer^3 over any of them when they die.”

“Make us firm in Islaam until the Day we meet You^1.
1). Or “And let us die as believers.” As was in the dua
of Hadhrat Yusuf υ: "Grant me death in a state of
obedience (as a Muslim) and include me among Your
pious bondsmen (the Ambiyaa in the Aakhirah) ” {Surah Yusuf,
verse 101}. And like was the dua of the magicians of Firoun,
who accepted Hadhrat Moosa υ: "O our Rabb! Grant us
fortitude (patience) and give us death as Muslims (as
people who submit themselves to You) ” {Surah A'raaf, verse 126}.

As for those who take out proof from these two Aayaat
that it is permissible to desire death, they have no basis in
this for such a claim. The duas in these Aayaat are
regarding their asking for death upon Imaan and not for
death per se.

We agree with doing Salaat^2 behind any of the people of
the Qiblah whether right-acting or wrong-acting,
2). As Allaah Taala says: **_“And bow_** _(in Ruku)_ **_with those who bow_** _(in Ruku)_ **_”_** {Surah Baqara, verse 43}. The implication of Ruku is Salaat. There is no exclusion of pious and impious in this Command. As Nabi ρ said: _“Perform Salaat behind any pious person or sinner.”_ The Sahabah ψ performed Salaat behind evil rulers (i.e. the era after the Khulafaa-e-Raashideen), and they did not repeat any of these Salaats. As it is reported in Bukhaari Shareef that Hadhrat Abdullah Ibn Umar (radhiallahu anhuma) performed Salaat behind Hajjaaj bin Yusuf, who was a thorough faasiq and oppressor. Also, Hadhrat Anas Bin Maalik τ performed Salaat behind him (Hajjaaj). Hadhrat Abdullah Ibn Masood τ and others performed Salaat
behind Waleed Bin Uqbah Ibn Abi Mu`eet. As Nabi ρ said
as reported in Bukhaari: “Those who lead the Salaat for
you, if they are correct (in their actions, etc) then (the
reward thereof) will be for you and for them, and if they
err, you will still get your reward and it (the sin of their
ways) will be against them.”

and doing the funeral prayer^3 over any of them when
they die.”
3.) As Allaah Ta`ala says regarding the Munaafiqeen:
Do not ever perform (the funeral) salaah for any of them
who die and do not stand over their graves (to bury them
or to visit their graves). Undoubtedly they disbelieved in

Allaah and His Rasool ρ and died as disobedient people
(as Kuffaar) " {Surah Taubah, verse 84}.

The reason for the impermissibility of performing Salaat
for any of them is their kufr. Negating permissibility for
any thing necessitates permission for its opposite.
Hence, it follows and is established that Salaat for

believers is ordained, regardless of whether they are pious
or sinners.

“We do not say that any of them will categorically^1 go to
either Jannah of Jahannam, and we do not accuse^2 any
of them of kufr (disbelief), shirk (associating partners
with Allaah), or nifaaq (hypocrisy), as long as they have
not openly demonstrated any of those things. We leave
their secrets to Allaah. We do not agree^3 with killing any
of the Ummat of Muhammad, may Allaah bless him and
grant him peace, unless it is obligatory by Shari'ah to do
so.”
“We do not say that any of them will categorically^1 go to
either Jannah of Jahannam,
1). That is for any specific person, the discussion of
which has passed – Except those for whom Nabi ρ has said
that they will enter Jannah, like the Ashara Mubash sharah,
etc.

and we do not accuse^2 any of them of kufr (disbelief),
shirk (associating partners with Allaah), or nifaaq
(hypocrisy), as long as they have not openly demonstrated
any of those things. We leave their secrets to Allaah.

2). It is quite clear that we cannot make any ruling
regarding this as it is a secret matter which is known only
to Allaah Ta`ala. We have no knowledge of this, so how
can we say anything regarding it.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "And do not pursue what you have
no knowledge about (do not comment on subjects you have
no knowledge about or speak about something that has not
been verified). Indeed questioning (on the Day of
Qiyaamah) shall take place with regard to (what) the ears
(heard) , (what) the eyes (saw) and (what thoughts and
wrong beliefs) the hearts (harboured) " {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse
36}.

It is also not appropriate for us to rule against anyone,
merely due to suspicion and conjecture, as Allaah Taala says: **_O you who have Imaan! Refrain from excessive assumption_** _(assuming evil things about people without verification)._ **_Verily, some assumptions are a sin_** _(good assumptions about people are however encouraged)"_ {Surah Hujuraat, verse 12}. Nor can we degrade anyone, as Allaah Taala
says: O you who have Imaan! Men should not mock
other men for perchance they (those mocked) may be
better than them (those who mock). Neither should any
women mock other women, perchance they (the mocked
ones) may be better than them (those who mock) " {Surah
Hujuraat, verse 11}.

We do not agree^3 with killing any of the Ummat of
Muhammad, may Allaah bless him and grant him peace,
unless it is obligatory by Shari'ah to do so.”
3). As Allaah Taala says: **_"It is not for (not becoming of) a Mu’min to kill another Mu’min except (unless) by mistake"_** {Surah Nisaa, verse 92}. As Allaah Taala says:

"Whoever purposely murders a Mu'min (regarding his
act as a permissible act) , his punishment shall be
Jahannam where he shall live forever. Allaah shall be

angry with him, curse him and has prepared for him a
dreadful punishment" {Surah Nisaa, verse 93}.

‘Al-Khulood’ (dwelling forever in Jahannam) here, refers
to him staying in Jahannam for a very long period of time.
If the killing was regarded as being permissible (whilst in
actual fact it was not), then the word ‘Khulood’ will be
according to its actual meaning, and that is remaining in
Jahannam forever. It is reported in the Saheeh from
Rasulullaah ρ: “The blood of a believing person is not
permissible, if he testifies that there is none worthy of
worship but Allaah and that I am the Rasool of Allaah,
except in one of three cases; a married adulterer; a soul
for a soul; and one who leaves the Deen, who separates
himself from the Jamaat (of Muslims).”

“We do not recognize^1 rebellion against our Imaam or
those in charge of our affairs even if they are unjust^2 .”

1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "O you who have Imaan!

Obey Allaah, obey the Rasool ρ and those in command
among you (your leaders and authorities in all fields) "
{Surah Nisaa, verse 59}. Reflect upon how Allaah Taala orders _“Obey the Rasool”,_ but He does not say _“obey the Ulool Amr (those in command)”._ This is so because the obeying of the Ulool Amr is no different to obeying Allaah Taala
and Rasulullaah ρ. The verb “Obey” is repeated before the
word “Rasool” because Nabi ρ will never instruct except
what is ordered by Allaah Ta`ala. He is sinless. However,
as for the Ulool Amr, if they order contrary to Allaah and
His Rasool, then one is not obliged to follow them. They

are only to be followed as long as they order what Allaah
and His Rasool have ordered. It is for this reason that Nabi
ρ said: “(It is binding) Upon a Muslim man that he listen
and obey to that which is liked by him or disliked. Unless
he is ordered with sin. If he is ordered with sin, then he
does not have to listen or obey.”

those in charge of our affairs even if they are unjust^2 .”
2). Allaah Taala has not subjugated us to them except due to our sins. Therefore the result is in accordance to the type of sin. Allaah Taala says: " In a like manner (as We
have made some humans the friends of some evil Jinn) We
make some of the oppressors companions of others
because of the (evil) deeds that they perpetrate (sinners
committing the same sin will suffer the same punishment in
the Aakhirah) " {Surah An'aam, verse 129}.

“Nor do we wish^1 evil on them, nor do we withdraw from
following them. We hold^2 that obedience to them is part
of obedience to Allaah, The Glorified, and therefore
obligatory as long as they do not order to commit sins.”
“Nor do we wish^1 evil on them, nor do we withdraw from
following them.
1). Because this will be tantamount to rebelling against
them internally. We do not rebel against our rulers as long
as they do not order us with sin. It is narrated from the
previous scriptures: “I am Allaah. I am the King of all
kings and king of the hearts. The hearts of the kings are in
My Hands. As for those who obey Me, I make them (rulers)
merciful towards them. And as for those who disobey Me, I
make them (rulers) a punishment upon them. Do not

concern yourselves because of your rulers. However, turn
in repentance (to Me) and I will make them become
favourable towards you.”

We hold^2 that obedience to them is part of obedience to
Allaah, The Glorified, and therefore obligatory as long as
they do not order to commit sins.”

2). Indeed Allaah Ta`ala has ordained subservience to

them, in His Command: "Obey Allaah, obey the Rasool ρ
and those in command among you" {Surah Nisaa, verse 59}. and
then He referred to them (your rulers) as “Ulool Amr”. The
commentary of this has just passed. Hence, obedience to
them is obedience to Allaah and His Rasool, as long as
they do not order with sin. When they order sin, then they
fall out from the obedience of Allaah and His Rasool,
hence their obedience is also forfeited. When they
themselves fall out of the obedience of Allaah, then how
can they be worthy of being obeyed?

Nabi ρ said: “He who follows me has indeed followed
Allaah. He who disobeys me has disobeyed Allaah. He who
obeys his Ameer (Leader) indeed he has obeyed me, and he
who disobeys his Ameer has indeed disobeyed me.” [This
is so unless he (the Ameer) does not order one to sin].

“We pray^1 for their right guidance and pardon from their

wrongs. We follow the Sunnah^2 of the Prophet ρρρρ and the
Jamaa`ah of the Muslims.”
“We pray^1 for their right guidance and pardon from their
wrongs.

1). Because Deen is for every Muslim to be sincere and
mean well towards Allaah, His Rasool (sallallahu alaihi
wasallam) and the Ummat, just as Nabi ρ has advised us.

We follow the Sunnah^2 of the Prophet ρρρρ and the
Jamaa`ah of the Muslims.”
2). Sunnah is the way of Nabi ρ. This is the perfect
example. Al-Jamaa`ah refers to his followers. The best
Faqeehs (those who understand the Deen) are the Sahaabah
and those who follow them in a perfect way, until the day
of Qiyaamah.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Whoever opposes the Rasool
after the guidance (the truth of Islaam) has become
manifest (clear) to him and follows a path other than that
of the Mu'mineen, We shall allow him to do that which
he is doing and then enter him into Jahannam. It is the
worst of abodes" {Surah Nisaa, verse 115}.

Nabi ρ said: “Indeed the Ahle Kitaabain (Jews and
Christians) have segregated in their religions into 72 sects.
And indeed this Ummat will segregate into 73 sects. All of
them are destined for the Fire, except one.” The Sahaabah
asked: “Who is this one sect, O Rasulullah”. Nabi ρ
replied: “Those who are on my path and the path of my
companions.”

The words of Nabi ρ “Those who are on my path”
indicates towards the Sunnah. By his saying: “And the
path of my companions” indicates towards the Jamaaah. It is for this reason that the followers of the Sunnah and the Jamaaah are called “Ahle Sunnah Wal Jamaa`ah”, in

keeping with these words of this Hadith. Nabi ρ has
expounded with these valuable words of his that all the
opponents of this way will be annihilated. Be this
opposition to both these aspects (Sunnah and Jamaaah) or be it to only one of the two. The Ahle Sunnah Wal Jamaaah have stuck on firmly to this path by their rigid
following of the Salf-e-Saaliheen (pious predecessors). In

this regard, Hadhrat Ibn Masood ττττ reports: “Whoever
desires to be close to us, thus he should hold on to the
Sunnah of those who passed away, because indeed the
living are not (assured) of being saved from fitnah. Those

are the Companions of Muhammad ρ. They were the best
of this Ummat. They were (amongst the Ummat) the most
devout in their hearts (beliefs), the deepest in knowledge;
they were the least unnatural (in their manner). Allaah
Ta`ala chose them to be the Companions of His Nabi and
the establishers of His Deen. You should know (and
recognize) their virtue and follow in their footsteps. You
should hold on fast to their character and Deen as close as
you can. Indeed they were on the guided Path.”

Hence we regard The Jamaat as the Truth and correct, and
falling astray (from The Jamaat) as deviation and
punishable.

***********************************************
********

“And we avoid^1 deviation, differences and divisions. We
love^2 the people of justice and trustworthiness.”
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Indeed you (O Muhammad

ε ) have nothing to do with those (Jews and Christians)
who caused divisions (sects) in their religion (by

accepting parts of it and rejecting parts) and have split
into groups (denominations. Therefore, do not worry too
much about them). Their matter rests with Allaah.
Thereafter (in the Aakhirah) He will inform them of what
(evil) they used to do (and punish them accordingly) " {Surah
An'aam, verse 159}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "Do not be like those (Jews and
Christians) who separated (into denominations because of
their desires) and disputed (about the basics and
secondary aspects of their religions) after clear signs had
come to them. There shall be a terrible punishment for
such people" {Surah An'aam, verse 105}.

We love^2 the people of justice and trustworthiness.”
2). Indeed to have love for the just ones is amongst the

Sunnats of Allaah Taala. As Allaah Taala says: "If you
judge, then judge between them with justice. Verily
Allaah loves the just ones" {Surah Maa'idah, verse 42}.

Trustworthiness is also beloved to Allaah Taala. As Allaah Taala says: "Those who give due regard to
(fulfilling) their trusts (things placed in their trust) and
their promises, who stand firm by their testimony (they do
not allow anything to change their testimony) and who
guard their salaah (ensure that the time and method of
performing salaah are correct and they never allow any
salaah to pass by unperformed). These people shall be
honoured in the gardens of Jannah" {Surah Ma'aarij, verses 32-35}.

It is natural (and obvious) that entrance into the abode of
blessedness with honour and respect will be achieved by
love and affiliation and not by malice and hatred.
Rasulullaah ρ said: “When Allaah created family ties and
trustworthiness...they said: ‘Know, whoever joins us and

maintains us, Allaah will join him and whoever severs us,
Allaah will sever him.” It is clear that to join and maintain
ties are the fruits of love. Just like separation is the fruit of
hatred. Love for those who are just and trustworthy are
amongst the Sunnats and characteristics of Allaah Ta`ala.

We are ordered to inculcate those characters which are
similar to the characters of Allaah and follow the Sunnah
of Allaah Taala and to keep an affiliation to the Path of Allaah. It is necessary for us to have love for the just and trustworthy ones, by virtue of these two honourable Aayaat and the Hadith of Nabi ρ. Also, Allaah Taala says;
"However, the Mu’mineen have a much greater love (at
all times) for Allaah" {Surah 2, verse 165}. It is necessary for us
to love them owing to our love for Allaah Ta`ala, because
the lover also loves that which the Beloved loves, and he
befriends the friends of the Beloved, and he is pleased with
those with whom the Beloved is pleased.

**_***********************************************

“And we hate_**^1 the people of injustice and treachery.
When our knowledge about something is unclear, we say^

(^2) : ‘Allaah Knows Best.’”
“And we hate^1 the people of injustice and treachery.
1). Love must be complete as is deserving of love in the
beloved actions, in the same way it is necessary for us to
have hatred for the undesirable actions. Hence, those who
love Him and His friends owing to their love for Him, it is
imperative that they hate His enemies owing to His hatred
and dislike (for them). If not (i.e. one cannot have hatred
for the disliked ones), then his love is also incomplete. It is
at this juncture that Jihad in the Way of Allaah Ta`ala
begins and is initiated, due to this hatred. They are the

treacherous, rebellious and unjust. To have hatred for
them is also amongst the rights of love and Imaan. As
Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah can soon bring (create)
another nation whom He loves and who love Him; who
will be kind towards the Mu'mineen, stern towards the
Kuffaar and who will strive in Allaah’s way (to uplift
Islaam) without fearing the criticism (condemnation,
abuse) of those who criticise (unlike the Munaafiqeen who
feared the criticism of the Kuffaar) " {Surah Maa'idah, verse 54}.

Rasulullaah ρ said: “That person’s Imaan is complete who
loves for (the Pleasure of) Allaah, hates for (the Pleasure
of) Allaah , gives for (the Pleasure of) Allaah and prevents
for (the Pleasure of) Allaah.

When our knowledge about something is unclear, we say^
(^2) : ‘Allaah Knows Best.’”
2). Sheikh begins in his speech by saying that the
person is not contented in his Deen if he is not contented
with Allaah. He reverts that knowledge which he does not
know to the Knower thereof. Hence, that person who
speaks regarding the matters of Allaah without any
knowledge, whether it is from his opinion or by his natural
understanding, indeed he is following his desires.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Who can be more unjust
(misguided) than the one who follows his whims without
any guidance from Allaah?" {Surah Qasas, verse 50}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "There are those people who,
without (relevant) knowledge, dispute with you about (the
being, the attributes or actions of) Allaah and they follow
(the dictates of) every rebellious Shaytaan. The decision

has been passed against him (Shaytaan) that he will
mislead whoever befriends him (whoever does as he
wants) , and he will lead him to the punishment of the
Blaze (Jahannam) " {Surah Hajj, verses 3-4}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "those who dispute about Allaah’s
Aayaat without any warrant (justification) coming to
them. This is extremely detestable in the sight of Allaah
and in the sight of those who have Imaan. Thus (by
allowing people to continue their evil ways) does Allaah
set a seal on the heart of every haughty and tyrannical
person (because of which they are unable to accept the
truth) " {Surah Mu'min, verse 35}.

Hence it is imperative for every servant of Allaah to say
with regard to those things which he does not know about:
“Allaah Knows Best.” That is, he reverts it to the Knower
thereof. As Nabi ρ said: “Leave that which you do not
know for that which you know.”

“We agree^1 with wiping over leather socks (in Wudhu)
whether on journey or otherwise, just as it has come in
the (consistent and confirmed) Ahaadith.”
1). It has been consistently reported from Nabi ρ that
masah (passing of wet hands) on leather socks is
permissible and feet must be washed. The Rawaafidha
(Shiahs) contradict this Sunnah-e-Mutawaatirah, in the
severest way, and they claim that the Fardh (of Wudhu) is
to make masah on the feet upto the ankles. They refute the
making of masah on leather socks. They have made this
issue a distinctive differentiation between the Ahle Sunnah

and themselves. The Ahle Haqq have included this as part
of our Deen and have included this Masalah as being a necessity of our beliefs (Aqeedah), just like the Aqaaid-e-
Qati Mutawaatira (definite consistent beliefs). Hence, those who report Wudhu from Nabi ρ, by way of speech and action, are those who practiced upon it and they do not make Wudhu except in this way (that they have learnt from Nabi - sallallahu alaihi wasallam). They made Wudhu during his era and he saw them making Wudhu and consented to it. They reported it to those who followed them. There were multitudes of them who received this message. This act (i.e. making masah on feet) was not a well-known one amongst the Arabs in the era of ignorance. Those who saw him (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) washing his feet during Wudhu are so numerous in number that none besides Allaah Taala knows their exact quantity. The
washing of the feet has been reported from Nabi ρ in
numerous authentic Ahaadith. It also appears in the Sihaah
(authentic Kitaabs of Hadith), amongst others. The
Ahaadith on “Ahqaab” (back of ankles), etc. bear
testimony to this. The consistent and continuous chain of
narrations regarding Wudhu include the washing of the
feet. The Aayat of Wudhu also does not contradict the
Sunnah. The action of the Raafidha is rejected by the
Qur`aan, Sunnah and consistent actions (of Salf-e-
Saaliheen).

It is for this reason that Sheikh has placed this part of the
Masalah amongst our basic Aqaaid. You should know
that the words “Masah on feet” that appears in some
narrations is a warning that not too much water be used
when washing the feet, contrary to the normal habit of
people who waste water when washing the feet.

This Mas`alah is well-known and much is spoken about it
in the different Kitaabs (of Fiqh and Ahaadith).

“Hajj^1 and Jihaad^2 are Fardh”

“Hajj^1 and
1). These two Ibaadaat are joined and mentioned
together because they have a speciality that is not to be
found in any other act of Ibaadat. They are Ibaadaat that
have to do with travelling. They have a relation to moving,
maneuvering, walking, running, etc. Jihaad has to do with
the sphere of bravery and valour for Islaam. The
expounding of both these subjects is a topic on its own,
which we not dilate upon here. Nevertheless, with regard
to Hajj, Allaah Ta`ala says: "Hajj (pilgrimage to show
love for Allaah) to the House (the Kabah) is a duty that
people who are able to find a way there owe to Allaah
(therefore, Muslims who can afford to go to Makkah to
perform Hajj have to do so) " {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 97}.

Jihaad^2 are Fardh”
2). As for Jihaad, Allaah Ta`ala says: "O Nabi ρ! Strive
(wage Jihaad) against the Kuffaar and the hypocrites and
be stern with them (for their reformation). Their abode is
Jahannam. What an evil place to return to (in the
Aakhirah) !" {Surah Taubah, verse 73}.

The object of Jihaad is to oppose Fitnah and to elevate the
Kalimah of Allaah Taala. As Allaah Taala says:
"Continue fighting them until no corruption (especially
no Shirk and turning others away from Islaam) exists and
until religion (worship) is only for Allaah (until people
worship Allaah only). Should they stop (being Kaafiroon) ,

then let there be no attacks except against the
oppressors" {Surah 2, verse 193}.

“Under^1 the leadership of those in charge^2 of the
Muslims, whether they are right^3 or wrong-acting are
continuing obligations until the Last Hour comes.
Nothing can annul or controvert them.”
“Under^1 the leadership
1). As Nabi ρ said: “Jihaad will continue until the Day
of Qiyaamah.” This is in actual fact an order which is in
the form of an informatory sentence. Or it is an
informatory sentence which informs us of its continuity
until the Day of Qiyaamah. It is an encouragement towards
this action.

of those in charge^2 of the Muslims,
2). This is from amongst the conditions of Jihaad.
Sheikh intends with this sentence, refutation of the Shiahs.
Because they aver that there is no Jihaad in the path of
Allaah Ta`ala until the consent emerges from the Noble
Family of Muhammad ρ, and a caller calls out from the
skies that he be followed. The falsehood of this averment
of theirs is very clear.

whether they are right^3 or wrong-acting are continuing
obligations until the Last Hour comes. Nothing can
annul or controvert them.”
3). The Rawaafidh place this condition on an Imaam that
he be Ma`soom (sinless). They have no proof for this, in
fact this averment of theirs is against the proof, because
Nabi ρ used to distribute the Imaamat amongst the pious
and the sinners. He used to stress upon obedience to them,

without differentiating between the good and the sinners. It
is reported in Saheeh Muslim from Hadhrat Auf Bin
Maalik Al-Ashja`ee, he says: “I heard Rasulullaah ρ
saying: ‘The best of your leaders are those whom you love
and who love you, whom you make dua for and who make
dua for you. The worst of leaders are those whom you
detest and who detest you, whom you curse and who curse
you.’ He says: ‘ We asked: ‘O Rasulullah! Should we not
renounce them at that time?’ He replied: ‘No, (unless) they
do not establish Salaat amongst you. If someone is
appointed over you and you see in him a sinful act, then
you should detest it. If they do not commit any sin, then you
should not raise a hand against them.’”

Nabi ρ did not say that the Imaam must be sinless. The
Rawaafidh (Shiahs) are the worst of people regarding this
Mas`alah, because they have rendered the Imaam sinless
and immortal. It does not benefit them in this world or in
the hereafter, since they claim that their awaited Imaam is
the one who entered into a vault. He will emerge at an
appointed time, when a caller will call out: ‘O our master
emerge! O our master, emerge!’ Only at that time will they
unsheath their weapons. As for their claim of the Imaam
being sinless, there is no need for this, since in order to
accomplish the task at hand. Since Hajj and Jihaad are
devotions related to travel, it is necessary for the leader to
be able to ward off the enemies and to curb further
mischief and destruction. In this respect, this can be
achieved by a pious and a sinful Imaam.

“We believe in Kiraam^1 and Kaatibeen (the two noble
Angels who write down our actions). Allaah has
appointed them over us as two guardians.”

1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: Verily there are guardians
(angels) upon you (with every person) who are noble and
are (continuously) recording (everything you do and say).
They know what you do" {Surah Infitaar, verses 10-12}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "For everyone there are followers
(guardian angels) in front of him and following behind
him, protecting him (from harm) by Allaah’s order" {Surah

Ra'ad, verse 11}.
Allaah Ta`ala says: "Or do they think that We do not hear
their secrets and their stealthy meetings (conspiracies)?
Most certainly We do (know) , and Our scribes are with
them (at all times) , writing (everything they say and do) "
{Surah Zukhruf, verse 80}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "Indeed Our messenger angels record
whatever you plan (nothing goes unnoticed) " {Surah Yunus,
verse 21}.

Regarding this there are numerous Ahaadith that expound
and explain these Aayaat.

“We believe^1 in the Angel of Death who is charged with
taking the spirits of all the worlds. We believe in the
punishment in the grave for those who deserve it, and in
the questioning^2 in the grave by Munkar and Nakeer
about one’s Rabb, one’s religion and one’s Prophet, as
has come down in Ahaadith from the Messenger of
Allaah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam). May Allaah bless
him and grant him peace, and reports from the
Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them all.”
“We believe^1 in the Angel of Death who is charged with
taking the spirits of all the worlds.
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Say (to them in reply) , “The
angel of death, who is appointed over you, will claim your
souls (when the time for your death arrives and you will
suffer terribly) , after which you will be returned to your
Rabb (to account for your actions and beliefs in this world
and then be punished) " {Surah Sajdah, verse 11}.

Allaah Ta`ala says : "He is Mighty (has control) over His
bondsmen and sends guardians (angels) to you (some to
protect you from calamities and others to record all your
deeds) until the time comes when death overtakes any of
you. Then Our messengers (the angels of death) extract
his soul without neglect (without neglecting their duty).
Then they (the souls) are returned to Allaah, their True
Master (when they will be judged). Lo! Judgement is His
(prerogative) and He is the fastest of those who take
reckoning" {Surah An'aam, verses 61-62}.

We believe in the punishment in the grave for those who
deserve it, and in the questioning^2 in the grave by
Munkar and Nakeer
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "So Allaah saved him from
the evils of the plots they made, and a terrible punishment
enveloped the people of Fir’oun (when they were drowned
in the Red Sea). They (Fir'oun and his followers) will be
presented before the Fire morning and evening (in their
graves). And, on the day that Qiyaamah will take place,
(the angels will be told) “Enter the people of Fir’oun into
the worst of punishments" {Surah Mu'min, verses 45-46}.

As Nabi ρ said: “The grave is either a garden from the
Gardens of Jannah or a pit from the Pits of The Fire.”

The narrations regarding the punishments and the blessings
in the grave are consistent and continuous. It is imperative
that we bring Imaan in this. We should not discuss the
types and conditions (of the punishments or rewards), as
our intellect will be able to comprehend this.

about one’s Rabb, one’s religion and one’s Prophet, as
has come down in Ahaadith from the Messenger of
Allaah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam). May Allaah bless
him and grant him peace, and reports from the
Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them all.”
3). Regarding this there is a lengthy Hadith, reported
from Hadhrat Baraa Bin Aazib. He reports that Rasulullaah
ρ said: “Thus his soul will return to his (physical) body,
and two Angels will come to him [in one narration it is
reported] black and dark-coloured [in one narration it is
mentioned] they are called Munkar and Nakeer. They will
sit by him and ask him: ‘Who is your Rabb?’ He will say:
‘My Rabb is Allaah’. They will ask him: ‘What is your
Deen?’ He will reply: ‘My Deen is Islaam.’ They will ask
him: ‘Who is this man who was sent amongst you?’ He will
reply: ‘He is the Rasool of Allaah.’ They will ask him:
‘What knowledge do you have?’ He will reply: ‘I recite the
Kitaab of Allaah (Qur`aan Majeed), I brought faith in it,
and I accept it as truth.’ A caller will call out from the
skies: ‘Indeed My slave has spoken the Truth. Spread a
way for him to Jannah and open for him a door to Jannah.’
He said: ‘He will get a scent and essence of Jannah and
his grave will be expanded for him as far as his eyes can
see.’ He said: ‘A handsome, beautifully clothed and
sweetly scented man will approach him and say: ‘Rejoice
with that which pleases you. This is the Day you have been
promised.’ He will ask the man: ‘Who are you? Your
countenance exudes goodness.’ He will reply: ‘I am your

good deeds’.... In a similar way a Kaafir will also be
questioned in the grave, but his condition will be the
opposite to that of a believer.”

This Mas`alah is long and needs lengthy explanations. For
further elucidation refer to the Kitaabs on the subject.

“The grave^1 is either one of the meadows of the Garden
of Jannah or a pit of the pits of The Fire. We believe in
being brought back to life^2 after death.”
“The grave^1 is either one of the meadows of the Garden
of Jannah or a pit of the pits of The Fire.
1). The commentary of this has past just now regarding
the punishment in the grave.

We believe in being brought back to life^2 after death.”
2). This is the being brought to life after death. As
Allaah Ta`ala says: "Behind them is “Barzakh” (a barrier
preventing their return, which will remain in place) until
the day that they are resurrected (until the Day of
Qiyaamah). When the trumpet is blown (to signal the
advent of Qiyaamah) , neither shall there be any family
ties between them (each person will disassociate from
his/her relatives fearing that their relatives may ask them
for rewards, which they so desperately need for
themselves) , nor will they ask about (the welfare of) each
other (because each person will worry only about
himself) " {Surah Mu'minoon, verses 100-101}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "The Kuffaar think that they will
never be resurrected. Tell them, “Definitely by the oath of
my Rabb! You will certainly be resurrected and then you

will be informed of what you did. This is very simple for
Allaah” {Surah Taghaabun, verse 7}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: “ (While living in the world,) Did you
think that We had created you in vain (for no purpose)
and that you would not return to Us (to answer for what
you did in the world) ?” {Surah Mu'minoon, verse 115}.

The reality of the resurrection - that is, whether we will be
resurrected with body or soul - the explanation of this will
follow shortly in the statements of the author !ا $%&ر.

“And in being recompensed^1 for our actions on the Day
of Judgment, and Al-Ardh^2 , having been shown them
and Al-Hisaab, brought to account for them. And
Qira`at-al-Kitaab^3 , reading the book.”

“And in being recompensed^1 for our actions on the Day
of Judgment,
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says that He is “Master of the Day
of Recompense” {Surah Faatiha, verse 3}. The word “(Yowm-i)
Deen” , in this context refers to Recompense.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "On that day (of Qiyaamah)
Allaah will give them the full payment (punishment) due
to them, and they will know that Allaah is verily the
Truth (the True and Absolute judge) and the One who
discloses (the truth of) matters" {Surah Noor, verse 25}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "Fear the day (of Qiyaamah) when
you (all) shall be returned to Allaah (for reckoning) , then
every soul will be repaid in full and they shall not be
oppressed (neither will one be deprived of any reward that

one deserves nor will one be punished for any sin that one
did not commit) " {Surah Baqara, verse 281}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "On the Day of Qiyaamah, you will
see that the faces of those who lied about Allaah will be
dark (gloomy and depressed). Is there not an abode (a
place to live) in Jahannam for the arrogant? (Jahannam
is exactly where they will find themselves.) Allaah will
rescue those with Taqwa to their place of success
(Jannah). No evil (punishment or distress) will touch
them, neither shall they grieve (over the past as the
Kuffaar will do) " {Surah Zumar, verses 60-61}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "(Do not forget) The day (of
Qiyaamah) when the trumpet will be blown and all within
the heavens and the earth will be terrified, except those
whom Allaah wills (those whom Allaah wishes to save
from fear will have no fear). (When people rise from the
graves,) They will all come to Allaah in humility" {Surah
Naml, verse 87}.

There are numerous such examples, denoting the Day of
Qiyaamah, from the Qur`aan

and Al-Ardh^2 , having been shown them and Al-Hisaab,
brought to account for them.
2). This refers to an easy reckoning. It is termed in the
Shari'ah “Al-Ardh”. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "As for him
who is given his record (of his actions) in his right hand
(indicating his entry into Jannah) an easy reckoning (Al-
Ardh) will be taken from him (his every action will not be
scrutinised) ...

An easy reckoning is Al-Ardh. There will not be anyone
who will be able to dispute the reckoning on the Day of

Qiyaamah, except that they will be punished. Hence, a
disputative reckoning will be a difficult one. Al-Ard will be
an easy reckoning.

And Qiraat-al-Kitaab_**^3 **_, reading the book.”_** 3). The Books (of deeds) will fly into the hands on the Day of Qiyaamah. Thus, he who gets his book in the right hand, he will be dealt with an easy reckoning and he will be entered into Jannah. And he who gets his book in his left hand, he will have a difficult reckoning and he will be entered into the Fire. May Allaah Taala save us all from
this. The basis for this is in the Aayat: **"We have bound
every person’s_** (record of) actions on his neck (wherever a
man may be, his every act is recorded).** (Eventually, when
he dies, this record is closed until finally) On the Day of
Qiyaamah We shall take out for him a book (this record
containing all his actions he carried out in this world) that
he will see opened before him. (It will then be said to
him) “Read your book. Today you are enough to take
stock of yourself (you can see your actions for yourself
and you need no one else to question you) ” {Surah Bani Israa'eel,
verses 13-14}.

***********************************************
********
“And the reward^1 or punishments”

1). This is the recompense. It will be done through
rewards and remunerations or punishments and
chastisements. Thus rewards will be recompense and
punishment will be encumbrance/burden. Nevertheless,
regarding reward, Allaah Ta`ala says: "it is only on the
Day of Qiyaamah that you will be given your rewards in
full" {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 185}.

And regarding the load (punishment), Allaah Ta`ala says:
"Whoever turns away from it (the Qur'aan by refusing to
believe that it is from Allaah) will surely carry a burden
(of sin) on the Day of Qiyaamah (which will lead him to
Jahannam). They will remain (in Jahannam) in this
condition (burdened with sin) forever. It shall be a terrible
burden indeed for them on the Day of Qiyaamah
(because it will lead them to Jahannam) " {Surah TaaHaa, verses
100-101}.

Firstly, recompense, will be the personification of the good
deeds, as Allaah Ta`ala says: "...and (the value of) his
(man's) efforts shall soon be seen (on the Day of
Qiyaamah) after which he will be repaid in full (for all his
actions) " {Surah Najm, verses 40-41}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: Whoever (sincerely) does an atom’s
weight of good will see it (its consequences when he is
rewarded for it) and whoever does an atom’s weight of
evil (without securing Allaah’s forgiveness for it) will see it
(its consequences when he is punished for it) " {Surah Zilzaal,
verses 7-8}.

Secondly, honour and degradation, with witnesses on the
Day of Qiyaamah. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "On the Day of
Qiyaamah, you will see that the faces of those who lied
about Allaah will be dark (gloomy and depressed). Is
there not an abode (a place to live) in Jahannam for the
arrogant? (Jahannam is exactly where they will find
themselves.) Allaah will rescue those with Taqwa to their
place of success (Jannah). No evil (punishment or distress)
will touch them, neither shall they grieve (over the past as
the Kuffaar will do) " {Surah Zumar, verses 60-61}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "...on the day (of Qiyaamah) when
some faces will be illuminated (bright with joy because
they belonged to the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah) while
others shall be gloomy (depressed and scared because of
their kufr, hypocrisy and impiety) " {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 106}.

Thirdly, recompense will be the remuneration, as Allaah
Ta`ala say: "...after which he will be repaid in full (for
all his actions) " {Surah Najm, verses 41}.

Fourthly, the manner of recompense for them will be
multiplied manifold, as Allaah Taala says: **_"Whoever brings a good act_** _(carries out an accepted act)_ **_will receive ten times as much_** _(in reward, and even more)_**_._** _(On the other hand,)_ **_Whoever carries out a sin will be punished only as much_** _(as the extent of the sin)_ **_and will not be oppressed_** _(the punishment for any sin will not be multiplied)_ **_"_** {Surah An'aam, verse 160}. Fifthly, success or failure, nevertheless as for success, as Allaah Taala says: "And save them from difficulties. You
have certainly showered Your mercy on the one whom
You have saved from difficulties on that day (of
Qiyaamah). This is indeed the greatest success" {Surah Mu'min,
verse 9}.

As for failure, as Allaah Ta`ala says: So when Allaah’s
command (punishment) comes, judgement will be passed
with the truth and, on that occasion, the people of
falsehood will be at a loss" {Surah Mu'min, verse 78}.

And lastly, eternity in Jannah or in the Fire, as Allaah
Ta`ala says: "Some of them (creation) will be
unfortunate, while others will be fortunate. As for those
who will be unfortunate, they will certainly be in the Fire,
where they will scream and shout (with sounds resembling

the braying of a donkey). They will live there forever as
long as the skies and the earth exist (until eternity) , except
as your Rabb wills (if Allaah wills that the period be
shortened, He may shorten it for whom He wills. However,
Allaah will not will that a Kaafir should emerge from
Jahannam because eternal punishment has been promised
for him). Undoubtedly your Rabb can perfectly
accomplish whatever He wills. As for those who shall be
fortunate, they will certainly be in Jannah, where they
will live forever, as long as the skies and the earth exist,
except as your Rabb wills (if Allaah wills that the period
be shortened, He may shorten it for whom He wills.
However, Allaah will not will that a Mu'min should emerge
from Jannah because eternal happiness has been promised
for him). This prize (reward) will never end. So do not be
in doubt about what (idols and false gods) these people
worship (worshipping their gods will certainly earn them
Allaah’s punishment). They merely worship as their
forefathers worshipped before (and will therefore suffer
the same fate as their forefathers). Verily We shall grant
them their full share (of punishment) without deduction
(reprieve) " {Surah Hood, verses 105-109}.

“And in Al-Siraat^1 (the Bridge) and Al-Mizaan^2 (the
Balance)”

“And in Al-Siraat^1 (the Bridge)
1). This is a bridge over Jahannam. On this Day of
Qiyaamah, there will be total darkness surrounding the
people. The Believers will have the Noor of their Imaan
glittering, whereby they will be able to cross over the
Bridge. This Bridge will be sharper than a sword and more
delicate than a hair. It will be a personification of the

Shari'ah. Whosoever remained steadfast on the Shari'ah in
this world will remain equally steadfast on the Bridge ion
the Day of Qiyaamah.

Whosoever slipped off the Shari'ah in this world will slip
off the Bridge to the same extent on the Day of Qiyaamah.
Below the Bridge will be hooks of steel which will hook
onto the feet of those traversing it. They will be the
personification of the Fitnahs of this world, which are ever
on the lookout to hook onto the people. Whosoever
traversed the earth whilst always wary of the Fitnahs will
traverse the Bridge safe from the traps therein. Whosoever
was always prey to the Fitnahs of the world will fall prey
to the traps and hooks of the Bridge. It is stated in the
Quraan Shareef: **_"Every one of you shall pass by it_** _(everyone shall pass over Jahannam as they cross the bridge of Siraat that spans Jahannam)_**_. This is a decreed command of your Rabb"_** {Surah Maryam, verse 71}. This is the passing over the Bridge. Allaah Taala says: "Then We
shall rescue those with Taqwa and We will leave the
oppressors (the Kuffaar and sinners) in it (Jahannam) on
their knees" {Surah Maryam, verse 72}.

and Al-Mizaan^2 (the Balance)”
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "On the Day of Qiyaamah,
We will erect the scales of justice (to weigh the good and
bad actions of people) and no soul will be oppressed
(wronged) in the least. Even if a deed (good or bad) is
equal to the weight of a mustard seed, We shall bring it
(to be weighed on the scales). We suffice as Reckoners
(and need no one else for the task) " {Surah Ambiyaa, verse 47}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Whoever’s scales are weighty
(with good acts on the Day of Qiyaamah) shall surely be
successful (because they will enter Jannah). (On the other

hand) Whoever’s scales are light (lacking good and heavy
with sins) , these are the ones who have put themselves at
a loss and shall remain forever in Jahannam" {Surah
Mu'minoon, verses 102-103}.

The Scales on the Day of Qiyaamah will be with two
balances. The good deeds will be placed on the one
balance and the bad deeds on the other, as mentioned in a
Hadith. We understand from the Quraan Majeed that there will be numerous scales on that Day and from the Ahaadith we understand there to be only one Scale. It is possible that the import of the word ‘Mawaazeen’ (plural for scale) used in the Quraan Majeed refers to the various items to be
weighed. In this way we reconcile between the Qur`aan
and Ahaadith.

***********************************************
********
“And Al-Ba`ath, which is the resurrecting^1 of the bodies
and souls on the Day of Qiyaamah.”

1). That is the resurrection will take place with body.
Bodies will be resurrected and it will be given life on the
Day of Qiyaamah after its death (in this world). Indeed
Allaah Taala will give life and resurrect whoever is in their graves, and this does not refer to the soul since souls are not buried in graves and there is no meaning in saying that they will be given life and resurrected. As Allaah Taala says regarding the Kuffaar: "On the Day of
Qiyaamah We shall raise them (those gone astray) on
their faces, (and they will be) blind, dumb and deaf. Their
abode shall be Jahannam" {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 97}.

The words face, blind, deaf and dumb are specialities of
the body and physical structure of man and not of the soul.

As Allaah Ta`ala says, refuting the denial of the kuffaar
regarding the resurrecting of the bodies: "They (the
Kuffaar mockingly) say, “Is it that when we turn into
bones and pieces (when out bodies decompose after
death) , we will be resurrected as a new creation?” Say
(to them) , “You may (even) become stones or iron or any
other creation that seems appealing in your hearts (even
if you wish to turn into things that seem lifeless, more
lifeless than decomposed bone and flesh, Allaah will still
resurrect you after death) .” Soon they will say, “Who will
resurrect us?” Say, “He Who created you the first time
(from nothing can certainly create you again from your
decomposed matter) ” {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verses 49-51}.

The statements of the kuffaar as far-fetched and unlikely is
the resurrection of the bodies and not the souls. It is for this
reason that they mention bones and body parts. Allaah
Ta`ala replies to them by saying that the same Being Who
had created these bones and body parts the first time will
do so for a second time. The issue here is that they regard
the renewal of the body a second time as being far-fetched
based on its creation the first time. The answer to their
question is the confirmation of the resurrection of the
bodies and its creation for a second time. If the resurrection
was regarding the souls then this would not be a suitable
answer to their objection, since even they do not regard the
resurrection of the souls as being far-fetched.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "O people! If you are in doubt
about (the possibility of) resurrection, then (remember)

We have certainly created you (your father Aadam υ )
from sand, then (the rest of mankind) from a drop of
semen, then (the development of the foetus progresses)
from a clot of blood, then (it develops further) from a
lump of flesh, which is shaped (perfectly) or unshaped

(deformed or miscarried) , (you were created in these
stages) so that We may show you (Our great power). And,
according to Our will, We keep you in (your mothers’)
wombs until an appointed time (when you are due to be
born, which is usually nine months). Thereafter, We
remove you (from your mothers’ wombs) as children, after
which you come of age. There are those of you whose
souls We claim (at an early age) , while others reach the
age of infirmity (senility) so that they know nothing after
once possessing (much) knowledge. And (another sign to
prove the possibility of resurrection is that) you will see
the earth barren (without vegetation and foliage,
seemingly dead) , then we send rains to it, causing it to
stir, flourish and grow every kind of beautiful species (of
plantlife). This (creation of man and reviving of dead
earth) all happens because Allaah is True (without Whom
none of this can take place) , because He (Alone) gives life
to the dead, and because only He has power over all
things and (all this all occurs because) Qiyaamah is about
to happen without any doubt and because Allaah will
surely raise those who are (lying) in their graves" {Surah Hajj,
verses 5-7}.

This is a deduction based upon the first creation of man
from a clot of blood to its remaining in the womb and its
emerging as an infant, which are all regarding the
conditions of the physical body. It is compared to its being
created a second time after its death. If the reference here
was regarding the soul only, then the deduction would not
have been correct and their claim that it is far-fetched
would not have been refuted. The statement “Indeed
Allaah will resurrect whoever is in the graves” proves that
the resurrection is with regard to the physical bodies and
not merely the souls, because the bodies are in the graves.
They will be resurrected after the soul is once more

imbued into it. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "He (man) quotes
examples for Us (disregarding Our status) and forgets
himself (forgets that he was once a lowly drop of fluid).
He says, “Who will give life to bones after they have
decomposed?” Say, “The One Who gave life to it the first
time (when He created it) will revive it. He has knowledge
of all things" {Surah Yaaseen, verse 78-79}.

Allaah Taala has proven the repetition of the creation based on the initial creation, and of the first creation on the second creation. Any intelligent person will understand that Allaah Taala has the Power to create for a second
time if He could do so the first time. If He is helpless for
the second creation than He should have been more
helpless the first time. Since the first creation was bodily,
then naturally the second creation will also be bodily. If
this was not the case then the proof of Allaah Ta`ala would
not have been appropriate. Since creation is dependant
upon the Creator and His Knowledge, it follows that the
first creation with all its parts and physical make-up. Will
be followed with a same creation the second time. When
the first creation was from nothing then the second creation
will be simpler from the leftover parts and bones.

Also, the resurrection will be for the retribution of the
deeds and actions, and this will be executed upon the body.
Although this will take place after the soul has been placed
into the body. Actions are executed with and are
specialities of the body and not the soul. Indeed actions are
the result and compilation of active and passive motions.
However, as for the soul, it is the source and the
fountainhead for actions. It has the guidelines, desire and
enthusiasm for actions. And then it makes the firm
intention and resolution to carry out the actions after it has

summed the goodness or evil of it. Hence the duty and task
of the soul is knowledge and the desire to carry out an
action, and NOT the actual action itself.

Active and passive motions and actions are not from
amongst the qualities of the soul. And now that it has
become clear that the duty and task of the body is actions,
it follows that the retribution of actions be carried out on
the body which is the executor of actions. This is not
possible except with the resurrection of the body. Since our
Nabi ρ was the Seal of all Ambiyaa, Allaah Taala perfected the Deen at his hands and he was the first sign of Qiyaamah. He expounded for us the many signs and the conditions of the hereafter, such that it does not appear in the Divine Kitaabs of the previous Ambiyaa. The philosophers have averred that Nabi ρ did not expound on the final destination of the bodies. And also that no Ambiyaa before him said anything regarding it so as to support him. These people have lied and falsified the Ambiyaa ا$#"م '()*+, because indeed the Quraan Majeed has
conveyed the Message that the destination of the bodies at
the time of death is the small Qiyaamah. As Nabi ρ said:
“When a person dies, indeed his Qiyaamah has begun.”
As far as the destination of the bodies in the big Qiyaamah,
this is well-known amongst the people as “Qiyaamah”. All
the Ambiyaa from the time of Hadhrat Aadam υ until the
last, have all informed their respective Ummats with regard
to the Day of Qiyaamah.

As Allaah Ta`ala says regarding Aadam υ: " (Addressing

Aadam υ , his wife and their unborn progeny,) He (Allaah)
said, “Go down all of you as enemies to each other. On
earth you shall have a place to live and a place to gain
benefit for a while (for as long as you live) .” He (Allaah)

said (further) , “There (on earth) you shall live, you shall
die and from there you shall be removed (to be
resurrected on the Day of Qiyaamah) .”

And when the accursed Iblees said to Allaah Ta`ala: "He
(Iblees) said, “O my Rabb! Grant me respite (time to live
and mislead people) until the Day (of Qiyaamah) when
people are resurrected.” He (Allaah) said, “You are then
from those given respite until the Day of the appointed
time” {Surah Saad, verses 79-81}.

Hadhrat Nooh υ said; "Allaah has created you (your

father Aadam υ ) from the earth in a unique manner. He
will then return you to the earth and then remove you
from it in a unique manner (when you are resurrected on
the Day of Qiyaamah) " {Surah Nooh, verses 17-18}.

Hadhrat Ibraheem υ said: “... (He) Who I hope will forgive
my shortcomings on the Day of Qiyaamah” {Surah Shu'araa,
verse 82}. Then he said: “And make me from the inheritors
of the bounteous Jannah” {Surah Shu'araa, verse 85}. And then he
said: “Do not disgrace me on the Day (of Qiyaamah)
when people will be resurrected...” {Surah Shu'araa, verse 87}.

Hadhrat Moosa υ said was told by Allaah Ta`ala:
“Qiyaamah is undoubtedly coming. I shall conceal (the
time when) it (will come. Qiyaamah will have to come) so
that every soul can be granted retribution (rewarded or
punished) for its efforts” {Surah TaaHaa, verse 15}.

A believer from the family of Firoun said, after he has
brought faith in Hadhrat Moosa υ: “O my people! Verily I
fear the day of Calling for you (referring to the Day of

Qiyaamah when people will be called to account for their
actions and they will also be calling to each other for help)
(the Day of Qiyaamah will be) the day when you will turn
back on your heels (in an effort to run away from
Jahannam) and there shall be none to protect you from
(the punishment of) Allaah. There can be no guide for the

one whom Allaah sends astray. Without doubt, Yusuf υυυυ
came to you with clear signs (to prove that he was
Allaah’s true Rasool) , but you remained in constant doubt
about what he brought to you until the time came when
he passed away, then you said, ‘Allaah shall never ever
send a Rasool after him (Allaah knows that it is futile to
send another because we will reject him just as we rejected

Yusuf υ ) .’ Thus does Allaah allow those people to go
astray who transgress the limits and who are sceptical;
those who dispute about Allaah’s Aayaat without any
warrant (justification) coming to them. This is extremely
detestable in the sight of Allaah and in the sight of those
who have Imaan. Thus (by allowing people to continue
their evil ways) does Allaah set a seal on the heart of
every haughty and tyrannical person (because of which
they are unable to accept the truth) .” (Scoffing Towheed,)
Fir’oun said, “O Haamaan, build a tower for me so that I
may reach the roads, the roads to the heavens so that I

can have a close look at the Ilaah of Moosa υυυυ. I strongly
feel that he is a liar.” In this manner the evil of his
actions was made appealing to Fir’oun, and he was
prevented from the path (of the truth). The scheme of
Fir’oun led only to destruction. The one who had Imaan
said, “O my people! Follow me and I shall lead you to the
path of guidance. O my people! This worldly life is a
trivial gain (because it will soon come to an end).
Undoubtedly the Aakhirah (the life in Jannah) is really a
place to live (because it will not come to an end) ” {Surah
Mu'min, verses 32-39}.

Allaah Ta`ala informs us in the story of the cow: "We said,
“Strike it (the murdered corpse) with a piece of it (with a
piece of the slaughtered bull so that the dead man can tell
the people who murdered him) .” In a like manner does
Allaah bring the dead back to life and He shows you His
Aayaat (His power) so that you may understand (that just
as Allaah brought the dead man back to life, he will do the
same on the Day of Qiyaamah when He brings mankind
back to life) " {Surah Baqara, verse 73}.

Here Allaah Taala confirmed the resurrection of the Day of Qiyaamah, by an example in this world. That was the giving of life to the cow after its death. Allaah Taala says
that every Ambiyaa had informed his Ummat regarding the
Day of Qiyaamah and had warned them of the impending
Fire: “Did the Rusul from among you not come to you,
reciting to you the Aayaat of your Rabb and warning you
of this day’s meeting?” They will say, “Certainly.
However, (we failed to heed their advice. Because we died
as Kuffaar,) the decision of punishment has been passed
against the Kuffaar” {Surah Zumar, verse 71}.

This is an admission of the Kufaar that the Ambiyaa had
informed them of the Day of Qiyaamah. Allaah Ta`ala
informs us of the refutation of the Kuffaar of the
resurrection, and He had refuted their claim with a severe
reprimand: "They (the Kuffaar) swear their most solemn
oaths by Allaah that Allaah will never resurrect the dead.
No (Allaah shall certainly resurrect them)! It
(resurrection) is indeed a resolute promise that Allaah
has made, but most people do not know. (Resurrection
shall take place) So that Allaah may make clear to them
(to the Kuffaar) the matters in which they differed (with
the Mu'mineen) and so that the Kuffaar may come to

know that they were liars (in their statements when they
rejected the message of the Ambiyaa) " {Surah Nahl, verses 38-39}.

And Allaah says: "Do they not see that the same Allaah
Who created the heavens and the earth is capable of
creating the likes of them (who are much smaller than the
heavens and earth)? He has appointed for them a term
(their deaths and Qiyaamah) about which there is no
doubt. The oppressors (Kuffaar) refuse to do anything but
commit kufr (thereby continuously showing ingratitude to
Allaah) " {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 99}.

It is hereby confirmed that the belief of the resurrection
after death and the coming of Qiyaamah was well-known
and taught by all the Ambiyaa ا$#"م '()*+. Only, our Nabi ρ has
expounded on it and explained it more detail than has any
other previous Ambiyaa. Indeed he was the Seal of all
Ambiyaa and the perfection of all the Deens.

***********************************************
********
“The Garden^1 (Jannah) and the Fire (Jahannam) are
created things”

1). The existence of Jannah and Jahannam, as Allaah
Ta`ala states: "This (Qur'aan and mention of the Ambiyaa)
is advice (to people). Without doubt, those with Taqwa
will have a pleasant abode (where they will enjoy) eternal
Jannaat, with the doors opened for them (to welcome
them) " {Surah Saad, verses 49-50}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "This is it (so understand well that you
have to accept Imaan and do good to achieve it). As for
the rebellious, there shall be the worst of abodes. They

shall have to enter Jahannam. What a terrible resting
place indeed!" {Surah Saad, verses 55-56}.

These two (Jannah and Jahannam) are existent and present,
as Allaah Taala says: **_"He_** _(Allaah)_ **_has created everything, and then meticulously perfected them."_** {Surah Furqaan, verse 2}. As Allaah Taala says specifically regarding
Jannah: " Fear (being punished in) the fire that has been
prepared for the Kaafiroon" {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 131}. And
regarding Jahannam: "It (Jannah) has been prepared for
those with Taqwa" {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 131}.

Indeed Nabi ρ saw the reflections of Jannah and Jahannam
on the wall of the Kaabah. For a reflection of something to
be seen it has to be existent and present, otherwise a
reflection cannot be seen.

On the night of Miraaj, Nabi ρ saw _Jannahul Mawaa_ at
the side of Sidratul Muntahaa. Its beauty multiplies every
year during Ramadhaan. Allaah Taala adds to it many a new things. Allaah Taala says from the wife of Firoun: “O
my Rabb! Build for me a home by You in Jannah" {Surah
Tahreem, verse 11}, etc. The deceased’s place in Jannah or
Jahannam is presented before him in his grave. A door
from Jannah is opened for the Jannahis and he can smell
the beautiful scent therefrom.

Similarly, Jahannam is presented to the Kufaar every
morning and evening in their graves. Also, when Allaah
Taala created Jannah and Jahannam, He sent Hadhrat Jibraeel υ to Jannah and Jahannam and told him to look at them, etc. like this there are numerous Ahaadith of Nabi ρ that prove the existence of Jannah and Jahannam. This is contrary to what a group of the Mutazilas and

Qadariyyahs say, who have altered the meaning of the
Quraan Majeed. They aver that Jannah and Jahannam are retribution for actions, and there is no need for the retribution to be in existence prior to the actions being accounted for, hence (they say) Jannah and Jahannam will only be created on the Day of Qiyaamah, otherwise they will have to remain useless and idle for a long period of time. All these clear texts (from Quraan and Ahaadith) are
proofs against this claim of theirs. The proofs that they
present are merely proofs of their kufr.

***********************************************
********
“That never come to an end^1 or perish.”

1). That is, these two will remain forever and ever. As
the Quraan Majeed has informed us that those who have done good they will be in Jannah, forever dwelling therein, and those who are evil they will be in Jahannam, forever dwelling therein. Other Aayaat have passed regarding this. As Allaah Taala says: "They will not taste death there (in
the Aakhirah) , except for the first death (of this world
which would have already passed) " {Surah Dukhaan, verse 56}. As
Allaah Taala says: **_"...its fruits and shade will be permanent"_** {Surah Ra'ad, verse 35}. Allaah Taala says: “Indeed,
this is Our provision, which will never come to an end (so
you need never fear losing it) " {Surah Saad, verse 54}.

Allaah Ta`ala says to the Jews, refuting their averment that
the Fire will never touch them except for a few days: "Say

(to them, O Muhammad ε ) , “Have you taken a promise
from Allaah (to this effect) which He cannot break? (Not
at all! The truth is that) You are merely attributing to
Allaah statements about which you have no knowledge?
Without any doubt (you shall enter Jahannam and remain

there forever)! Those who commit evil (Shirk) and whose
evil acts have enveloped them (causing them to die as
Mushrikeen) , these are the ones who will be the occupants
(inhabitants) of the Fire (of Jahannam) where they will
live forever" {Surah Baqara, verses 80-81}.

As Allaah Taala says: **_"No difficulty shall afflict them there_** _(in Jannah)_ **_, neither will they be removed from there_** _(they will live in Jannah forever)_ **_"_** {Surah Hijr, verse 48}. As Allaah Taala says: "They will never be able to escape
from the Fire" {Surah Baqara, verse 167}. As Allaah Ta`ala says:
“Your abode will be the Fire, where you shall live
forever, except those whom Allaah wills" {Surah An'aam, verse
128}.

This exception is not one of their remaining therein
forever; it is an expounding of the encompassment of
Allaah’s Power and Will. That is, He will not remove them
from their everlasting remaining in Jannah or Jahannam.
Now, also, Allaah has the Absolute Power to change
whatever He Wills. But, He will not change it owing to His
Covenant. The object here is that the existence and
everlastingness of Jannah and Jahannam are not due to
themselves but rather they remain in existence owing to the
Will and Power of Allaah Ta`ala. He has the Power to
reverse it if He Wills, even though He will not do so.
Regarding the Hadith of Nabi ρ when, on the Day of
Qiyaamah, death will be slaughtered, it will be said: “O
Inmates of Jannah remain therein forever, there will be no
death henceforth and O dwellers of Jahannam remain
therein forever, there will be no death henceforth.” The
proofs from the Ahaadith regarding the everlastingness of
Jannah and Jahannam are too numerous to mention.

“We believe that Allaah created them before^1 the rest of
the creation and then created people to inhabit^2 each of
them.”
“We believe that Allaah created them before^1 the rest of
the creation
1). That is, before He created mankind. Thus every part
of the universe from the heavens to the sky and everything
that is in-between, from light, darkness, night, day, shade,
heat, Arsh, floor, sand, clouds, trees, animals, stars,
planets, life, death, good, evil, Jannah and Jahannam. All
these were created before the creation of man, during a
span of six days.

Hadhrat Aadam υ was created on a Friday, at the end of
the six days. This is so because all this was created for him
and not that he was created for all this. This is understood
from the Quraan, since all these things are from the necessities of man. As Allaah Taala says: "Allaah has
also placed at your service everything in the heavens and
everything on earth" {Surah Jaathiya, verse 13}. As Allaah Ta`ala
says: " We said, “O Aadam! You and your wife (Hawwa)
may live in Jannah and eat as much as (whatever) you
desire and from wherever you desire" {Surah Baqara, verse 35}.
The creation of Jannah before the creation of Hadhrat
Aadam υ is clear from this Aayat.

and then created people to inhabit^2 each of them.”
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Without doubt, We have
created a large number of Jinn and mankind for
Jahannam" {Surah A'raaf, verse 179}. It is reported in a Hadith of
Hadhrat Aishah 1-20 !ر34 ا on the occasion of a Janaazah of an
Ansaar baby: “O Aishah! Indeed Allaah has created for

Jannah its occupants, and He has created them for it whilst
they were still in the backs of their fathers. And He has
created inmates for the Fire, He created them for it whilst
they were still in the backs of their fathers.”

The entire creation is divided into two types;

The first type is those that are subservient to a set course,
the second type is those that operate according to their
intentions. The first type is guided by Allaah along and
upon their set path.

The second type are guided according to their intentions,
which are in accordance to their intelligence and
knowledge of what harms them and benefits them. This
second type is further divided into three types; one type
that intends nothing but good, no other intentions comes
from them except good, like the angels. The second type
are those who intend nothing but evil and nothing comes
forth from them except evil, like the shayaateen.

The third type are those who intend good and evil, like
humans. Then humans are divided into three types, one
type upon whom Imaan, intelligence and recognition
dominates over the lowly desires, thus they are like the
angels. The second type are those who are the opposite,
they are like the shayaateen. The third type are those
whose lowly animal desires dominate their intelligence,
they are like animals. It is therefore appropriate that each
of these types have a suitable abode which corresponds to
their respective status. Thus, Jannah is for those who are
similar to the angels, according to their levels they will be
accorded suitable abodes. Some will be higher in Jannah
and others will be lower. The second types will be
accorded abode suitable for the shayaateen, in Jahannam.

According to their evil some will be in the lowest depths of
the Fire and others will be in less punishment.

“Whoever He Wills goes to Jannah out of His Bounty^1
and whoever He Wills goes to the Fire through His
Justice. Everybody acts in accordance with what is
destined^2 for him.”

“Whoever He Wills goes to Jannah out of His Bounty^1
and whoever He Wills goes to the Fire through His
Justice.
1). The commentary on Bounty and Justice has already
passed.

Everybody acts in accordance with what is destined^2 for
him.”
2). The character, limits and conditions of every person
have been destined according to the Wish and Desire of
Allaah Taala. The Taqdeer of every person is known to Allaah Taala. And every detail has been recorded with
The Pen in the Lawh Mahfooz and in the suspended pages,
which linger on the neck of the slave whilst he is in the
womb of his mother. How long will his life-span be, how
will his actions be, will he be a good person or en evil
person – all this is in the Knowledge of Allaah Taala. The Pen has dried on this Knowledge of Allaah Taala. There is
no changing or alterations in this. Hence, all of man, from
the very first to the last, are subjected to what has been
destined and not to what is still about to happen. As Nabi ρ
said, as reported by Imraan Bin Hussein: “ Two men of the
tribe of Muzaina came to Allaah's Messenger (sallallahu
alaihi wasallam) and said: ‘O Rasulullah! What do you
say of people who do in the world and strive for, is

something decreed for them; something preordained for
them and will their fate in the Hereafter be determined by
the fact that their Ambiyaa brought them teachings which
did not act upon, and thus they would be punished?
Thereupon, he said: Of course, it happens as it is decreed
by Destiny and preordained for them, and this view is
confirmed by this verse of the Book of Allaah, the Exalted
and Glorious: ‘Consider the soul and Him Who made it
perfect, then breathed into it its sin and its piety.’”
[Muslim Shareef]

The summary is that everything and aspect of man’s life
has been destined by Allaah Taala. It is all encompassed in the Knowledge of Allaah Taala. It is not possible for
anyone to add or decrease from this. Everything is bound
to follow the path laid out for it and has been destined for
it. It is not possible for anything to exceed these bounds.

***********************************************
********
“And goes towards^1 what he has been created for. Good
and evil^2 have both been decreed for people.”

“And goes towards^1 what he has been created for.
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "...We shall make the
(means to attain) great comfort (Jannah) easy for him (by
making it easy for him to carry out good deeds). As for the
one who is miserly and indifferent (towards the truth of
Islaam) and who rejects the most beautiful word (the
Kalimah) We shall make the (means to attain) great grief
(Jahannam) easy for him (by making it easy for him to
commit sins) " {Surah Layl, verses 7-10}.

Good and evil^2 have both been decreed for people.”
2). The explanation of this has passed. The crux of this
from the definitive texts is that man is not forced or
coerced into any action that is destined in his fate. Indeed,
what has been decreed is not that man merely carries out
the action, in fact it is such that he does it with his own
intention and will, it is not that he is forced and coerced
into carrying out that particular action. Man is not forced
into carrying out any action. Taqdeer is that Allaah
Taala’s Knowledge includes the creation of man. Man is aware (knowledgeable) and not forced. Thus the Ever- Existent Wisdom of Allaah Taala includes the wisdom of
man in that he is not forced. And also, the Will of Allaah
Taala includes the will of man that it is also not forced. Thus from any angle one views it, the Taqdeer of man is not that he is forced in any way to carry out an certain action. It is not that a man is forced to sin because it is in his Taqdeer that he is going to sin. Compulsion has no play in Taqdeer. In short, Taqdeer does not negate the actions of man by his intentions and free will. It is for this reason that Allaah Taala confirms for man his earnings and actions
from the side of Taqdeer. And He has made the actions of
man a reason for his entry into Jannah or Jahannam, with
the confirmation of it being in his Taqdeer. As Allaah
Ta`ala says: " (It will be told to them,) “This is Jannah,
which you have been made to inherit because of the
(good) deeds you carried out" {Surah Zuhkruf, verse 72}.

Allaah Taala says regarding the Fire: **_"...so taste the punishment for your actions"_** {Surah A'raaf, verse 39}. A person will not be given retribution except after he has earned the reasons for the retribution. Thus the One Who creates the necessitating factors and reasons is Allaah and the one who earns and carries it out is the slave. There is no contradiction between the two. Like Allaah Taala creates
the child, but the child is not born except with the factors

which lead to his birth, and that is conception, etc. hence,
there is no contradiction between its creation and between
the conception of man.

***********************************************
********
“The capability of man^1 is of two types; the capability in
terms of Taufeeq (Divine Grace and Favour) which
makes an action certain to occur cannot be ascribed to a
created being. This capability is integral with action,
whereas the capability of an action in terms of having the
necessary health, and ability, being in a position to act
and having the necessary means, exists in a person
before the action. It is this type of capability which is the
object of the dictates of Shari'ah. Allaah, the Exalted
says: ‘Allaah does not charge a person except according
to his ability.’”

1). It is necessary for the Mukallif (person upon whom
the dictates of the Shari'ah are binding) to have the ability
(to do actions), because indeed the Deen prohibits such
difficulty which one is unable to execute. As Allaah Ta`ala
says: "Allaah does not place on a soul a responsibility
(duty) except what is within its capability" {Surah Baqara, verse
286}.

Ability and power are divided into two types. I would
assume that it is divided into three types; this is borne out
by the Author’s ,ا -./ر mentioning their qualities. If they are
divided into two types the third one is incorporated into the
second.

Firstly, that capability which is in the meaning of health,
opportunity, being in a position to act and having the
necessary means. All these attributes are necessary in a

slave prior to his executing an action. Because, indeed all
these attributes are connected with him being addressed
(by the Commandments of Allaah Taala). He is not addressed (or ordered to do something) unless the necessary means are available, as Allaah Taala says:
"Hajj (pilgrimage to show love for Allaah) to the House
(the Kabah) is a duty that people who are able to find a
way there owe to Allaah" {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 97}. As Allaah
Taala says: **_“so fear Allaah as much as you can”_** {Surah Taghaabun, verse 16}. As Allaah Taala says: "The one who
cannot even do this should feed sixty poor people" {Surah
Mujaadala, verse 4}. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Those of you who
do not have the means to marry free Mu'min women,
then (they should marry) one of your Mu'min slave girls"
{Surah Nisaa, verse 25}.

Secondly, that capability which is in the meaning of power.
This is necessary for the slave to posses at the time of
executing the action. With this (power) the action comes
into being. It is not possible for an action to take place with
a non-existent power. This is in the statement of Allaah
Ta`ala: "They have neither the ability to hear (the truth) ,
nor can they see (the truth because they do not want to
hear or see it despite the fact that they had the sense of
hearing and seeing) " {Surah Hood, verse 20}. The object is the
negation of the reality of power, and not the negation and
non-existence of the means and instruments, because this
was present and established. In the same way, Hadhrat
Khidr υ said to his companion (Hadhrat Moosa υ): “You
will surely not be able to bear (endure) with me" {Surah Kahaf,
verse 67}. He means here, the actual power, which is patience
and not the means of patience. These, the means for
patience are there and he did not chastise him because of
the lack of the means of patience but rather for his non-
ability to exercise that patience.

Thirdly, the capability which is special for the Mumin, which is in the meaning of having trust and reliance in Allaah Taala. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah has made
Imaan beloved to you, has made it beautiful within your
hearts and has made kufr, sin and disobedience
abhorrent to you. Such people (with these qualities) are
rightly guided. (This guidance is on account of) The grace
and bounty from Allaah. Allaah is All Knowing, the
Wise" {Surah Hujuraat, verses 7-8}.

The kuffaar are not rightly guided. As Allaah Ta`ala says:
"Whoever He desires to send astray, He narrows and
constricts his bosom (by means of wayward ideas so that it
cannot accept Imaan) as if he is (a person who is)
climbing into the sky (having great difficulty breathing
because of the scarcity of oxygen). In this manner (as such
a person experienced great difficulty) Allaah places
impurity (punishment, His curse or Shayaateen) on those
who do not have Imaan" {Surah An'aam, verse 125}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "The person whom Allaah guides
(grants understanding) is rightly guided (because only
Allaah can guide a person). As for him whom Allaah
(because of His great wisdom) sends astray, you shall not
find for him any guiding friend" {Surah Kahaf, verse 17}.

This is the object of the Author’s ,ا -./ر saying: “The first of
the two is the capability in terms of Taufeeq...” The
Mutazilas refute this and they aver that this affection, adoration and guidance applies to all of mankind. The Author ,ا -./ر refutes them by stating: _“Cannot be ascribed to (any) created being...”_ The Mercy and Grace of Allaah Taala is not for the kuffaar; rather this is a speciality of
the believers_._ The Author ,ا -./ر has divided the capabilities
of man into two types, which was his way of refuting the

belief of the Mutazilas. The Mutazilas and Qadariyyahs
claim that the servant does not have the ability before an
action. We, the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaa`ah believe, as
has just passed, that one of the types of capabilities which
is before the action, is in the meaning of health,
opportunity, being in a position to act and having the
necessary means. One of the capabilities is with the action,
and this is the power to execute the action.

And the final type of capability is the one which is the
speciality of the believers, and that is Taufeeq. This is the
Special Grace from Allaah Ta`ala.

***********************************************

“People’s actions are created^1 by Allaah but earned^2 by
people.”

“People’s actions are created^1 by Allaah
1). As Allaah Taala says: **_“And Allaah has created you and whatever you do”_** {Surah Saaffaat, verse 96}. In general, Allaah Taala says: "Allaah is the Creator of everything."
{Surah Zumar, verse 62}

but earned^2 by people.”
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "It (every soul) shall receive
to its favour that (good acts) which it had earned and to
its harm shall be what (sins) it had carried out" {Surah Baqara,
verse 286}. The Jabariyyah have claimed that the planning in
the actions of the creation are all executed by Allaah, and
not the servant. They claim that all actions are forced, like
the action of trembling (involuntary actions), and like the
movements of the trees and seas, etc. They have attributed
these actions to the creation (man) by way of figurative
expression, just like a thing is attributed to its source. The

Mutazilas, on the other hand have opposed this view. They aver that all intended actions of man are created by him and not by Allaah Taala. The Ahle Haqq, Ahlus
Sunnah Wal Jamaaah say that Allaah Taala is the Creator
of everything besides Allaah Himself. He created the
beings and their actions. The earner of these actions is the
creation, due to their intentions and choices. Indeed the
proofs of the Qadariyyahs are correct in that they denote
that the servant is the doer of the action, and he is the
intender thereof and he has a choice in it. However it (their
proofs) do not prove that indeed he is forced by Allaah and
that it takes place without the will and choice of Allaah
Taala. The proofs of the Jabariyyahs are correct in that they prove and indicate that Allaah Taala is the Creator of
everything and He has Absolute Power and Control.
However it does not prove that the servant is not the earner
of his actions and that he is not the doer thereof, or that he
does not intend it or has a choice in it. Hence the
Qadariyyahs exceed the bounds in establishing Qadr , and
they negate the doing of the servant. The Qadariyyah
exceed the bounds in negating Qadr. The Ahlus Sunnah
Wal Jamaaah, are, with the Mercy and Fadhl of Allaah Taala, on justice and on moderation. We do not exceed
the bounds on either side.

“Allaah, the Exalted, has only charged^1 people with what
they are able to do and people are only capable^2 to do
what Allaah has favoured them this is the explanation^3
of the phrase: ‘There is no power and no strength except
by Allaah.’ We add to this that there is no stratagem or
way by which anyone can avoid or escape disobedience to
Allaah except with Allaah’s Help; nor does anyone have
the strength to put obedience to Allaah into practice and

remain firm in it, except if Allaah makes it possible for
them to do so.”
“Allaah, the Exalted, has only charged^1 people with what
they are able to do
1). As Allaah Taala says: **_"Allaah does not place on a soul a responsibility_** _(duty)_ **_except what is within its capability"_** {Surah Baqara, verse 286}. As Allaah Taala says
regarding the dua of believers: "Our Rabb, do not enforce
on us that which we do not have the strength to bear"
{Surah Baqara, verse 286}.

and people are only capable^2 to do what Allaah has
favoured them
2). For the Aayat mentioned above to apply: "Allaah
does not place on a soul a responsibility (duty) except
what is within its capability" , The explanation of this is
that Allaah Ta`ala only charges His servants in accordance
to their abilities.

That is, there has to be equality between the two things in
order for it to apply. If the one side was not in parity to the
other than the concept would not apply. In other words, the
burden and the ability to be able to carry the burden (i.e.
execute the Commands of Allaah Taala) must be in communion with each other. The one cannot be more than the other or vice versa. The fact that Allaah Taala has said
that He will not burden a soul more than it is able to bear,
testifies to this fact that the ability of the soul is able to
withstand and carry the load that has been placed on it.

This Aayat directly testifies that the burden placed on
mankind is in accordance to the ability of man, and it
implies that the ability of man is in accordance to and
equal to the load that is placed upon it.

this is the explanation^3 of the phrase: ‘There is no power
and no strength except by Allaah.’ We add to this that
there is no stratagem or way by which anyone can avoid
or escape disobedience to Allaah except with Allaah’s
Help; nor does anyone have the strength to put obedience
to Allaah into practice and remain firm in it, except if
Allaah makes it possible for them to do so.”
3). Since it has been established that Allaah Taala, and none else, is the One Who has charged man with various duties, and that He is the One, and none else, Who has revealed the Deen, and He is the One, and none else, Who has placed the parity between ability and load, and He, and none else, Knows everything regarding it, and He has measured it even before its creation -- It becomes apparent and glimmers forth from Him, His Towheed (Oneness), His Power, His Oneness, His Desire, His Rule and His Oneness in charging the servants in all their affairs and matters. He has NO partner in His Commanding, Creation, Desire and Power. This here is the meaning and import of _Laa Howla Wa Laa Quwwata illa Billaah._ This Masalah
is a clear and apparent in establishing that Qadr belongs to
Allaah Ta`ala and it negates Qadr for the servants. Just as
Sheikh ,ا -./ر says: “There is no stratagem or way by which
anyone can avoid or escape disobedience to Allaah except
with Allaah’s Help; nor does anyone have the strength to
put obedience to Allaah into practice and remain firm in it,
except if Allaah makes it possible for them to do so.”

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "We grant to all (to both groups) ,
to these (those who desire the Aakhirah) and to those
(those who desire the world) from the grace (bounty) of
your Rabb (in this world). The grace (bounty) of your
Rabb is not restricted (Allaah gives to everyone without
His treasures being depleted) " {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 20}.

However, since it is possible that people may understand
that Allaah Taala constrains and forces man (into various actions), as is the belief of the Jabariyyahs, Sheikh ,ا -./ر counters this with the statement: _“His Will overpowers all other wills and His Decree overpowers all stratagems.”_ This does not negate stratagems and will of man, in that man has no will, choice or intention at all! Like he is a concrete object, with no intellect or understanding! This implies that indeed man has will and choice, but his will is subject to the Will of Allaah Taala. The will of man
cannot come into play except through the Will of Allaah
Taala. As Allaah Taala says: "You cannot will anything
without the will of Allaah the Rabb of the universe" {Surah
Takweer, verse 29}. The negation of stratagems of man does not
mean the negation of the servant’s earning it and executing
it. The earning and execution of it is by the choice and will
of man. However, the creation of the action is not from
man, but from Allaah Ta`ala, Who is the Creator of all of
man’s actions. The servant is the doer/earner of the action;
hence the creation thereof is attributed to him.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "In fact, (they refuse to believe
because) the rust of their sins has covered their hearts (so
that no truth can penetrate it) " {Surah Mutaffifeen, verse 14}.

As Allaah Taala says: **_"However, when they chose to be crooked_** _(to reject his message despite its clarity)_ **_, Allaah further twisted their hearts"_** {Surah Saff, verse 5}. It is for this reason that the Quraan has attributed all the actions of
man to themselves, when Allaah Ta`ala says: “Because of
what they used to do.” And: “Because of what they have
earned.” He has attributed the creation of the actions of
man to Himself: “And Allaah has created you and
whatever you do” {Surah Saaffaat, verse 96} ”, the explanation of

which has passed. This then is the summary of Towheed,
that all matters and creation is referred to Allaah Ta`ala
and His Will. However, this does not negate and nullify the
will and choice of man, his actions and earnings.

***********************************************
********
“Everything happens according to Allaah’s Will,
Knowledge, Predestination and Decree^1. His Will
overpowers all other wills and His Decree overpowers all
stratagems. He does whatever He Wills.”

1). “His Decree” refer to the Decree of existence and
the Decree of Shari'ah. Hence, Decree can be either
regarding existence or Shari'ah.

As for the Decree of existence, as stated in the Quraan Majeed: **_Within two days, Allaah then decreed them_** _(the skies)_ **_into seven skies_** " {Surah HaaMeem Sajdah, verse 12}. And as for the Decree of Shari'ah, Allaah Taala says: "Your Rabb
has decreed that you worship only Him and that you treat
your parents kindly" {Surah Bani Israa'eel, verse 23}. Similar with
regard to the matters of existence and the matters of
Shari'ah. As for the matters of existence, Allaah Ta`ala
says: "When He wills anything, His only command is to
say, “Be!” and it comes into bein" {Surah Yaaseen, verse 82}.

As for the matters of Shari'ah, Allaah Ta`ala says: "Verily
Allaah instructs (people to carry out) justice, Ihsaan (do
things well, as well as doing everything with the
consciousness that Allaah is watching) , and giving
(charity) to relatives. And Allaah forbids immoral
behaviour, evil and oppression. He advises you so that
you may take heed (and thereby save ourselves from ruin
and Jahannam) " {Surah Nahl, verse 90}.

As far as permission is concerned, there is also permission
related to existence and another related to Shari'ah. As for
existence, Allaah Taala says: **_"However, they can never harm anyone with it_** _(with black magic)_ **_without Allaah’s command_** _(permission)_ **_"_** {Surah Baqara, verse 103}. As for permission in Shari'ah, Allaah Taala says: "Every date
palm that you (Muslims) cut (and burnt) or left standing
on its roots was by Allaah’s permission" {Surah Hashar, verse 5}.

Al-Kitaab, also, relates to existence and Shari'ah. As for
the Kitaab of existence, Allaah Taala says: **_"Recorded in the Book_** _(the “Lowhul Mahfoodh”)_ **_is every aged person who ages_** _(who reached old age)_ **_and_** _(every person)_ **_whose age is decreased_** _(who does not reach old age)_ **_"_** {Surah Faatir, verse 11}. As for the Kitaab of Shari'ah, Allaah Taala says:
"We commanded them (the Bani Israa’eel) in it (the
Torah) , “A life (of the murderer will be taken) for a life (of
the one murdered) , an eye (of the attacker will be blinded)
for an eye (of the one whom he blinded) , (similarly) a nose
for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth..." {Surah
Maa'idah, verse 45}.

As far as Ruling is concerned, it is either regarding
existence or Shari'ah. As far as Ruling of existence is
concerned, Allaah Taala says from the sons Hadhrat Yaqub υ: "Now I shall never leave this land (to return
home) until my father permits me or (until) Allaah
decides my matter (by either taking my life or returning my
two lost brothers). He (Allaah) is the best of deciders
(judges) " {Surah Yusuf, verse 80}. As for the Ruling of Shari'ah,
Allaah Ta`ala says: " Permitted for you (to eat) are
livestock animals (cattle, camels, goats, sheep) except
what has been recited to you (in the Qur'aan, such as
verse 3 of this Surah). (The hunting of) Game is (also)

unlawful for you when you are in the state of Ihraam.
Verily Allaah commands what He wills (He is All Wise,
above questioning) " {Surah Maa'idah, verse 1}.

Similarly, prohibition is also related to existence and
Shari'ah. As far as existence is concerned, Allaah Ta`ala
says: “Undoubtedly it (this holy land) is forbidden to them
for forty years. (In the meantime,) They will wander (lost
and bewildered) on earth (in the Valley of Teeh). So do
not grieve over the disobedient nation" {Surah Maa'idah, verse 25}.

As far as prohibition as far as Shari'ah is concerned, Allaah
Taala says: **_Forbidden for you_** _(for you to eat)_ **_is carrion, blood_** _(that flows from an animal’s body)_ **_, the meat of pigs..."_** {Surah Maa'idah, verse 3}. Regarding all these rights it is said that the actions of man are with (dependant on) the Intention of Allaah Taala, His Knowledge, His Decree,
His Ruling, and His permission, be it with regard to
existence or Shari'ah. However, His Intention, Decree,
Will, Ruling and Permission takes place depending on the
intention of the servant. The Action and Decree of Allaah
Taala does not negate the will and choice of the servant. Just as it is established that the Decree of Allaah Taala
takes place with His Intention and Will, with regard to the
actions of the servant, it is established that the earnings of
the servants of Allaah take place with their intentions and
wills. The servant does not have an independent and full
control which is diverse from Allaah Taala, he is in fact subservient to Allaah Taala in its (the action’s) creation
and taking place.

***********************************************
********
“And He^1 is never unjust.”

1). This is exonerating the Being of Allaah Ta`ala from
oppressing His servants, or from His having an
abomination for them, since they are His creation. That is,
He is the Creator of their actions , be they good or evil.

This is a midway between the Qadariyyah and Jabariyyahs.
May Allaah Taala save us from such statements of the Qadariyyahs who say that as long as there is no oppression or abomination from the servants there will be no oppression or abomination from Allaah Taala. Since
oppression does not take place except when the perpetrator
is ordered to do so from someone else, and Allaah Taala is not like that. Also, oppression takes place in the property of another, and there is no partner for Allaah Taala in His
Property. Hence, every occurrence that takes place in the
universe are from Allaah Ta`ala. They are occurrences that
take place in His Property and not in the property of any
other. So where can there be oppression (from Him)?

“He is Exalted in His Purity above any evil or perdition
and He is Perfect far beyond any fault or flaw. ‘He will
not be asked about what He does^1 , but they will be
asked.’ There is benefit for dead people in the
supplication^2 and alms-giving of the living.”

“He is Exalted in His Purity above any evil or perdition
and He is Perfect far beyond any fault or flaw. ‘He will
not be asked about what He does^1 , but they will be
asked.’
1). Questions are raised and asked regarding a thing
which occurs with the non-existence of proof. And since
Allaah Ta`ala is The Proof, in fact all proofs will be
regarded as proof when it is connected with the Truth and

justice. Truth and Justice are from the Being of Allaah
Ta`ala, Who is Pure. Hence, who is there that can question
Him? What proof will they ask for? When His Honoured
Being is The Proof of all proofs, He can never be asked
regarding what He does., rather it is He Who will ask (his
servants).

There is benefit for dead people in the supplication^2 and
alms-giving of the living.”
2). There is consensus amongst the Ahle Sunnah Wal
Jamaaah that the dead benefit from the efforts of the living (made on their behalf), in various ways. The Author ا,-./ر has mentioned two such ways; the dua of the believers and the Astaghfaar made by them for the deceased, as Allaah Taala says: "Those who come after them say, “O

our Rabb! Forgive us and our brothers (the Sahabah ψ )
who passed before us with Imaan" {Surah Hashar, verse 10}.
Similar are the duas that have been reported in the Sunnah,
like the dua for a Janaazah, the dua at the time of burial,
the dua at the time of visiting the graves -- all these are
beneficial to the deceased. The second is Sadaqah (charity)
and spending of wealth on behalf of the deceased. That is,
Ibaadat-e-Maaliyyah (acts of worship done with wealth).
Like the Hadith of Hadhrat Aishah 1-20 !ر34 ا where she used to
give Sadaqah on behalf of her mother after the consent of
Rasulullaah ρ that the reward reached her (the mother).
Examples such as this are manifold in the Sunnah.

“Allaah responds^1 to people’s supplications and gives^2
them what they ask for. Allaah has Absolute Control over
everything and nothing has any control over Him.”

“Allaah responds^1 to people’s supplications
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: “Supplicate (make du’aa) to
Me, I shall respond (in a manner that is most beneficial

for you) " {Surah Mu'min, verse 60}. A s Allaah Ta`ala says: "And
when My bondsmen ask you about Me, verily I am close
by (so call only on Me). I answer the prayer of the caller
when he calls" {Surah Baqara, verse 186}.

Dua is the most powerful weapon and means of gaining
benefit (from Allaah Taala). It is also a means of eradicating harm, to such an extent that even the kuffaar have to take cognisance of this point, in that they call unto Allaah Taala in their times of need, as Allaah Ta`ala says:
"When they board a ship (which is struck by bad weather
and then threatens to sink) , they pray to Allaah (to save
them) with sincere belief in Him (knowing that only He
can save them) " {Surah Ankaboot, verse 65}. He says regarding
people in general that when any harm befalls them they
call unto Him from their sides or when they are sitting or
standing. Nabi ρ said: “He who does not ask from Allaah,
Allaah becomes angry with him.” This is the opposite of
people who when asked become angry and agitated. As a
poet puts it:
“My Rabb becomes Angry if I do not ask from Him,
and Bani Aadam, when asked, becomes angry.”
and gives^2 them what they ask for. Allaah has Absolute
Control over everything and nothing has any control over
Him.”

2). As Allaah Taala says: **_"Or_** _(is)_ **_He Who responds to the distressed_** _(helpless)_ **_person when he calls Him_** _(for help)_ **_"_** {Surah Naml, verse 62}. As Allaah Taala says: "I shall
respond". And He says: "I answer the prayer of the caller
when he calls" , as has passed. It is established from here
the necessity to resort to means.

Indeed dua is also a means of success and a means of
achieving one’s objective, in fact it is the most powerful of

all means. Thus means are a necessity in this universe. But
to rely solely on the means is shirk and is contrary to
Towheed, and to terminate and exclude it (means)
completely is a deficiency in intelligence. To turn
completely away from resorting to means is a censure and
malignment in the Shari'ah. Hence to be completely
independent of means is folly and spurious. It is a form of
degradation. To make use of means and combine it with
trust in Allaah Ta`ala is an act of Ibaadat.

3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "To Allaah belongs the
kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is
within them. He has power over all things" {Surah Maa'idah,
verse 120}.

***********************************************
********
“Nothing can be independent^1 of Allaah even for the
blinking of an eye, and whoever considers himself
independent of Allaah for the blinking of an eye is guilty
of unbelief and becomes one of the people of perdition^2.
Allaah is angered^3 and can be pleased^4 .”

1). As Allaah Taala says: **_"O people! You are all beggars before Allaah_** _(dependant on Him for everything)_ **_and_** _(Only)_ **_Allaah is Independent_** _(not in need of anyone or anything)_ **_, Most Worthy of praise"_** {Surah Faatir, verse 15}. The entire creation in the whole universe is dependant upon Allaah Taala for its existence, its remaining, its life, death,
sustenance, earnings and for all its movements. How is it
possible for the wholly dependant to be free of the wholly
independent? He is the All-Powerful Owner, the All-
Aware Creator, aloft are His Praises. Thus, whoever is
independent of Him is in the meaning of being in non-
existence or utterly destroyed.

2). Destruction.

3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Say, “Shall I inform you of
someone deserving worse punishment from Allaah?
(They are) The ones whom Allaah has cursed, is angry
with, some of whom He has transformed into monkeys
and pigs and (those) who worship the Shaytaan (by doing
whatever he directs). These people are in the worst of
positions (heading towards Jahannam) and have strayed
the most from the right (straight) path" {Surah Maa'idah, verse 60}.

4). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah was well pleased

with the Mu'mineen (the Sahabah ψ ) when they pledged
their allegiance to you (O Rasulullaah ρ ) beneath the tree
(at Hudaybiyyah) " {Surah Fatah, verse 18}. As Allaah Ta`ala says
regarding the Sahaabah: "Allaah is pleased with the first
to lead the way from the Muhaajireen, the Ansaar, and
those who followed them with sincerity and they are
pleased with Him" {Surah Taubah, verse 100}.

The mazhab of the victorious is that the Attribute of
Anger, Pleasure, Enmity, Friendship, Affection, etc. are all
attributable to and established for Allaah Taala just as are the Attributes of Hearing, Seeing, Life, Power, Knowledge, Speech, etc. they are all literally applicable to Allaah Taala not just figuratively. However, we are
unaware of its actual condition and operation. We do not
equate the Attributes of Allaah Ta`ala, like Anger, Mercy,
etc. to those found in man.

The similarity between the two (Attributes of Allaah and
that of man) are restricted to the words used, and not in
meaning. The Attribute of Pleasure and Anger is
established for Allaah Ta`ala in the way that is appropriate

to His Stature and Grandeur. When the anger of the Keeper
of the Fire and that of the Angels at the wrongdoers is
unlike the anger of man, because the Angels are not
composed and created from the same matter as man, in that
they are overcome by a rush of blood in their veins at the
time of anger as is man – what then would be your opinion
regarding the Anger of Allaah Ta`ala Who is Lateeful
Khabeer. He is free from any physical form and its
attributes. He is free from a soul and its necessities. He is
worthy of all Praise and Grandeur.

***********************************************
********
“But not in the same way as any^1 creature. We love^2 the

Companions of the Messenger of Allaah ρρρρ , but we do not
go to excess^3 in our love for any one individual among
them.”
“But not in the same way as any^1 creature.
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "There is nothing like Him
(nothing can compare with His Being or His qualities) and
He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing" {Surah Shura, verse 11}.
Just like His Hearing and Seeing in unlike any creation, so
too is His Pleasure and Anger unlike any of that of the
creation.

We love^2 the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah ρρρρ ,
2). Because indeed Allaah Taala loves them. As He says: **_"...whom He loves and who love Him"_** {Surah Maa'idah, verse 54}. It is imperative that any beloved to Allaah Taala is
also beloved to the entire creation. Indeed the love for the
Sahaabah is from the words of Nabi ρ: “Whoever loves
them (My Companions) he loves them because of his love
for me, and whoever despises them, does so because of his

despising me.” Thus whoever loves Nabi ρ it is necessary
and imperative that they love his Sahaabah as well. It is
impossible that they not love them.

but we do not go to excess^3 in our love for any one
individual among them.”
3). This is so because to have excesses (either way) is
from transgressing the bounds. This is prohibited in
Islaam, with regard to every aspect. Included in this
prohibition is the love for the Sahaabah. As Allaah Taala says: _“Do not exceed the bounds in your Deen, and do not say regarding Allaah except the Haqq.”_ The Rawafidh exceed the bounds in their love for the Household of Nabi ρ and the Khawaarij exceed the bounds in their enmity towards them. The Ahle Sunnah Wal Jamaaah tread the
middle path and exercise moderation in their love for the
Sahaabah, in that we love all the Sahaabah, without
excluding and isolating any one of them. We do not exceed
the bounds in our love for them and we say not except the
Haqq.

We do not exaggerate in praising them and claim that they
are sinless, like the Ambiyaa, neither do we say that that
were men just like ourselves who mix evil deeds with good
ones. Hadhrat Ali τ has indicated towards a path which is
in between these two, he said: “Two (types of) men will be
destroyed because of me, one (who) loves me excessively
and praises me with that which is not within me, and (the
other) who hates me, where he hurls falsities upon me.”

***********************************************
********
“Nor do we disown^1 any one of them.”

1). Like how the Rawaafidh (Shiahs) do. They do not
turn away and reject the Ahle Bait but have disowned
Hadhrat Abu Bakr, Umar (radhiallahu anhuma) etc. On the
other hand the Khawaarij have not turned away or rejected
the Shaikhain (Hadhrat Abu Bakr and Umar – radhiallahu
anhuma) but have disowned Hadhrat Ali and Uthmaan the
Ahle Bait (radhiallahu anhum). According to them all these
are to be necessarily killed. The Ahle Sunnah Wal
Jamaaah, accept all of them (the Sahaabah) and have placed them in accordance to their ranks and status, as they are justly worthy and deserving of, and not in accordance to desires and fancies. We accept and believe in what Nabi ρ said regarding the honour of the Khulafaa-e-Raashideen, the Ashara-e-Mubashshara, the Sahaabah, the Ahle Bait, etc. we say that all of them are just, just as the Quraan
Majeed has lauded them with praise. Love for them is
from the necessities and prerequisites of the Deen and
Imaan. They were the first narrators of the Deen from Nabi
ρ. Sheikh ,ا -./ر has stated this as a refutation against the
Rawaafidh and Khawaarij. The Quraan Majeed has not disowned any one of them (The Sahaabah), in fact it has sanctified all of them, in accordance to their status. Allaah Taala has testified in favour of His Pleasure with them
and with their pleasure with Him. As Allaah Ta`ala says:
"Allaah is pleased with the first to lead the way from the
Muhaajireen, the Ansaar, and those who followed them
with sincerity and they are pleased with Him. He has
prepared for them such Jannaat beneath which rivers
flow, in which they shall live forever. This is the ultimate
success" {Surah Taubah, verse 100}.

***********************************************
********
“We hate^1 anyone who hates them or does not speak well^

(^2) of them and we only speak well (^3) of them.”

“We hate^1 anyone who hates them
1). As Nabi ρ said: “Whoever despises them does so due
to his despising me.” Indeed the hater of the beloved is
naturally detestable by the lover. To love them (the
Sahaabah) is a part of our Deen and Imaan, like the
Quraan Majeed has stated: _“He (Allaah Taala) Loves
them and they love Him.”_ Whoever is beloved to Allaah
Taala must also necessarily be beloved to all those who love Him and obey Him. Whoever hates them (Sahaabah) must be hated by the people of the Quraan Majeed. This is
logical and natural.

or does not speak well^2 of them
2). Those who hate them are those who speak ill of them
and swear at them. Such people are, according to some
Ulama, to be necessarily executed and according to others
such people are to be banished.

and we only speak well^3 of them.”
3). As Nabi ρ said: “The best of eras are my own, then
the one after it and then the one after it.” Know! The
Qur`aan Majeed has singled them out with goodness and
special favour. This is an honour that none other besides
them (from the Ummat) are favoured with. This is because
they had seen Nabi ρ with their physical eyes. They heard
his honourable speech with their physical ears. They
touched his honourable hands with their physical hands.
They accompanied him in Imaan, without any
intermediary.

Their bodies, souls and heart were affected by his Noor.
This is a special favour granted to them which was not

granted to anyone else besides them. It is for this reason
that we claim that all the Sahaabah are just and their
consensus is a definite proof. Whoever denies them is a
kaafir, because their hearts were tested with Taqwa, as the
Qur`aan Majeed bears testimony: " (They are) the ones
whose hearts Allaah has (examined and) purified for
Taqwa" {Surah Hujuraat, verse 3}. This was not said for anyone
else besides them.

***********************************************
********
“Love of them^1 is a part of Islaam, part of belief and part
of excellent behaviour, while hatred of them is unbelief,
hypocrisy and rebelliousness. We confirm^2 that...”

1). This is a necessity and a pre-requisite of the Shari'ah,
which has been revealed regarding them. Love for them is
part of the name of Imaan. Also, it is explicit in the
statement of Nabi ρ; “(Fear) Allaah, (Fear (Allaah)
regarding my Companions, do not make them targets after
me (my demise), he who loves them does so owing to his
love for me and whoever hates them does so due to his
hatred for me, whoever has harmed them has harmed me,
and whoever has harmed me has harmed Allaah, and
whoever has harmed Allaah, it is soon that he will be
caught.” Since love for them is coupled with the love of
Nabi ρ, which is the basis of Imaan, it follows that love for
them through love for Nabi ρ is also part of Imaan.

2). The Author ,ا -./ر has mentioned the Masaala of Khilaafat and he has included it as being part of our Imaan and Aqaaid.

This is the truth in that it is part of our necessary Aqaa`id,
owing to its importance in our Deen. It is from amongst the

basis of the governing of the Deen. This has high priority
in Islaam. This is one of the means of safeguarding the
Deen of Islaam, which has been in practice from the time
of Hadhrat Aadam υ until the time of Nabiρ.had there not
been any Khilaafat, then anybody would have done to
Islaam whatever he pleases, there would be none to
prevent him. Khilaafat is also a central point and base for
the servants of Allaah Ta`ala, wherefrom emanates the
unseen Divine assistance. This is so because a Khalifah
does not become one except with the suitable
qualifications. It is not an election or a candidate of the
people of custom who elect in order to fulfil some custom.
If the unseen Divine assistance does not spring forth from
the Khilaafat, then it would not be possible for it to be
Allaah’s deputy on earth. A clear conclusion is that if there
existed no Khilaafat on earth then, the Muslims will
remain in disarray and confusion.

The Divine unseen assistance will not be prevalent
amongst them. Perfect Islaam will not remain. Indeed,
there is no perfect Islaam without a Jamaat, and there is no
Jamaat without an Imaam. What greater privilege can there
be other than this? What more necessity can there be than
the necessity of establishing a Khalifah on earth? It has
great effects on the souls of the masses. It illuminates the
hearts of the believers with peace, Imaan and Islaam.
Imaan, peace and security are the contributing factors
which save mankind from the emerging of fitnahs and
mischiefs.

Also, Khilaafat and kingship are two similar concepts, both
in name and form. Both of them have the meaning of
might and power. The people chose the concept of
kingship in the name of Khilaafat after the passing on of
the era of the Sahaabah. This was done in order to attain a

system of government and power, under the banner of an
Islaamic government.
They chose the name of justice, peace and strengthening
the Deen in order to turn the attention of the people
towards them. However, they abused this title and
oppressed the masses and caused much mischief and
deception. There were great wars and struggles for power
and in order to gain rulership and maintain it. They clothed
(their titles) with Deeni flavour and they threw the veil of
Aqaa`id upon their actions. They laid claim to rulership
through their lineage and they imposed it (their rule) on the
people. They thus changed the entire face of Khilaafat and
Imaamat. They subjected its meaning and import to suit
their own whims and fancies. They made the concept of
Khilaafat a battlefield of opinions and a means whereby it
caused division and a base for wars and battles.

People lost hope, optimism and anticipation in it.
Especially, if we reflect on our present era, wherein there
is darkness upon darkness. Such that if one puts his hand in
front of his face, he will not be able to see it. It is important
that we elaborate slightly on the cause of this despair and
the source of it, so that people may get to understand better
the difference between kingship and Khilaafat. The veil of
deception and confusion must be lifted, so that people may
understand what is needed to be understood.

On the face of it, the differences between kingship and
Khilaafat and the differences in their import cannot be
disclosed except with the explanation of both, their
peculiarities, their effects and their objectives, from the
Quraan and the Sunnah. It is not sufficient that we suffice upon the topic of Khilaafat or that we mention it with regard to our Islaamic Aqaaid, as has the Author !ا $%&ر. He
has sufficed upon the mere mentioning of the Khilaafat and

has not expounded on its different aspects or dilated upon
its discussion, owing to the era in which he was.

The people in that era understood well the meaning of
Khilaafat and its import. Theirs was an era of knowledge
and insight. There was no need to dilate upon the subject
and its opposing factors. However, ours is an era of
ignorance and deviation. It is an era where evil is not
differentiated from good. The evil is clothed in good and
virtue. It is necessary for us to dilate on the topic of
Khilaafat and kingship and to highlight the differences in
their import and objectives, in the light of the Qur`aan and
the Sunnah. This is in order to remove the veil which exists
over (the concept of) Khilaafat and to establish the Haqq,
and to eradicate that which people used to do.

“The Khilaafat^1 ”

1). The statement of the Author ,ا -./ر “We confirm the
Khilaafat” , i.e. the general Khilaafat is divided into two
types: the first is the Khilaafat of Allaah Ta`ala to His
servants, that is, the Ambiyaa.

Hence the first Khalifah of Allaah Taala on the earth were the Ambiyaa ا$#"م'()*+. As Allaah Taala says regarding
Hadhrat Aadam υ: “I am about to place a deputy on earth
(someone to enforce My commands on earth, referring to

Hadhrat Aadam υ ) " {Surah Baqara, verse 30}. And as Allaah
Taala says: **_“O Dawood! Indeed, We have made you a deputy on earth_** _(to ensure that Our commands are carried out)_ **_"_** {Surah Saad, verse 26}. And as Allaah Taala says regarding
Hadhrat Ibraheem υ: “I am going to make you a leader
(an Imaam) of people (to lead them in matters of Deen) "

{Surah Baqara, verse 124}. Our Nabi ρ has been made the Seal of
all the Khulafaa for all the people until the Day of
Qiyaamah. Obedience to him and following him remains
until the Day of Qiyaamah. Obedience to Nabi ρ is likened
to obedience to Allaah Ta`ala’s Himself. He says:

"Whoever obeys the Rasool ρρρρ (Muhammad ε ) obeys
Allaah (because Rasulullaah ρ conveys the message of
Allaah) " {Surah Nisaa, verse 80}.

Taking a pledge of allegiance at the hands of Nabi ρ is like
taking a pledge at the Hands of Allaah Taala. Allaah Taala says: "Indeed those who pledge their allegiance to

you (O Rasulullaah ρ ) they really pledge their allegiance
to Allaah (because they do this to please Allaah). Allaah’s
hand is above theirs (when they take the pledge because
Allaah approves of it) " {Surah Fatah, verse 10}. His throwing
becomes the throwing of Allaah Ta`ala, when Allaah says:

"...and you (O Rasulullaah ρ ) did not throw (the handful
of sand into the eyes of the Mushrikeen to temporarily
blind all of them) when you threw, but it was (actually)
Allaah Who threw" {Surah Anfaal, verse 17}. This is testification
and proof that Nabi ρ was the Khalifah of Allaah Taala in all matters. He was the Seal of all the Prophet, hence the Seal of this type of Khilaafat. As he (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said: _“I am the Imaam of the Ambiyaa.”_ The Ambiyaa are the Khalifaas of Allaah Taala and he
(sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was the Imaam of all of the
Ambiyaa. As Hadhrat Abdullah Ibn Abbaas τ said:

“Indeed Allaah has granted virtue to Muhammad ρ above
all the Ambiyaa and the inmates of the heavens.” The
Ambiyaa are the Khulafaa of Allaah Ta`ala, and they are
the best of Khulafaa υ.

***********************************************
********
“After^1 Rasulullaah ρρρρ ”
1). This is the second type of Khilaafat. This is the
Khilaafat of the Ambiyaa to the pious inheritors amongst
their Ummats. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Allaah has
promised those of you who have Imaan and who do good
actions that He will definitely make them successors (of
the rulers) on earth just as He had made those before
them successors. And He will certainly grant (great)
strength to the Deen that He has chosen for them and
will certainly replace their fear with peace (on condition
that) they worship Me and do not ascribe any as partner
to Myself. Those who are ungrateful after this are sinful
indeed" {Surah Noor, verse 55}.

When Allaah Taala says: **_"just as He had made those before them successors"_** proves the Khilaafat of the Ambiyaa ا$#"م '()*+ before Rasulullaah ρ. As Allaah Taala
testifies to it in another place, where He says regarding
Hadhrat Nooh υ and his nation: "so We rescued him and
those (Mu'mineen) with him in the ark (when the flood
came) and made them successors (they succeeded the
others as owners of their property) " {Surah Yunus, verse 73}.

Allaah Ta`ala says regarding the nation of Hud υ: "Recall
the time when He (Allaah) made you successors after the

nation of Nooh υυυυ " {Surah A'raaf, verse 69}. And Allaah Ta`ala
says regarding the nation of Hadhrat Saalih υ: "Remember
(the time) when Allaah made you successors after the
Aad and stationed" {Surah Yunus, verse 74}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says regarding Hadhrat Ibraheem υ after

he was given the Imaamat: "Ibraheem υυυυ said, “And from
my offspring (will You not make them leaders as well) ?”
Allaah replied, “My promise (of leadership) will not
extend to the oppressors (the Kaafiroon)" {Surah Baqara, verse
124}. That is the Khilaafat (Imaamat) will be given to the
righteous servants after him, and not to the oppressors. In
this way, after the demise of Nabi ρ, the Khilaafat was
passed on to the Khulafaa-e-Raashideen (radhiallahu
anhum). Just as is stated in the Qur`aan Majeed, they will
be granted succession on the earth. They are the Khulafaa-
e-Raashideen, and after them are the Khulafaa-e-
Mahdiyeen.

Qiyaamah will not dawn until twelve Khalifahs will
emerge from amongst this Ummat, as Nabi ρ said that
mankind will not come to an end until twelve men will rule
over them.

The first of the Khulafaa-e-Raashideen was Hadhrat Abu
Bakr τ, and the last of the Khalifahs in this Ummat will be
Imaam Mahdi υ who will appear in the last of eras. This is
indicated in the statement of Rasulullaah ρ when he said:
“How can this Ummat perish when I am the first of it,
Mahdi will be in the centre and Maseeh will be the last.”

“Went first^1 to Abu Bakr Al-Siddique τ , thus proving his
excellence^2 and superiority over the rest of the Muslims,
then to Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab τ , then to Uthmaan τ , and
then to Ali Ibn Abi Taalib τ. These are the Rightly-
Guided Khalifs and the upright leaders. We bear witness
that the ten^3 who were named by Rasulullaah ρρρρ , and who
were promised Jannah by him, will be in Jannah, as
Rasulullaah ρρρρ , whose word is truth, bore witness that
they would be. The ten are: Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthmaan,
Ali, Talhah, Zubair, Sa`ad, Saeed, Abdur Rahmaan ibn
Auf, and Abu Ubaidah Bin Jarraah. Their title was the
trustees of this Ummat (radhiallahu anhum ajmaeen).”
“Went first^1 to Abu Bakr Al-Siddique τ ,
1). There is unanimity and consensus amongst the
Ummat regarding Hadhrat Abu Bakr’s τ being the first
rightful Khalifah. However, as far as the reasons of his
being appointed as Khalifah, there are differing views.
Some opine that his election is indicated in the Nass, and
there is no doubt that the Nass is quite explicit and clear in
this regard. Some say that his appointment was by way of
election, which occurred at the time of need. It is possible
to combine these two reasons and say that his appointment
was by way of election which was based on the indications
of Nass. Hence his appointment was because of Nass and
by elections.

τ , thus proving his excellence^2 and superiority over the
rest of the Muslims, then to Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab τ ,
then to Uthmaan τ , and then to Ali Ibn Abi Taalib τ.
These are the Rightly-Guided Khalifs and the upright
leaders.
2). As Nabi ρ said: “The most virtuous of this Ummat
after its Nabi is Abu Bakr.” The method of electing the
Khalifah was executed in the best way possible by the
Sahabah ψ who are the best of the entire Ummat.

We bear witness that the ten^3 who were named by
Rasulullaah ρρρρ , and who were promised Jannah by him,
will be in Jannah, as Rasulullaah ρρρρ , whose word is truth,
bore witness that they would be. The ten are: Abu Bakr,
Umar, Uthmaan, Ali, Talhah, Zubair, Sa`ad, Saeed,
Abdur Rahmaan ibn Auf, and Abu Ubaidah Bin Jarraah.

anhum ajmaeen).”

3). As Nabi ρ said: “Abu Bakr (will be) in Jannah,
Umar (will be) in Jannah, Uthmaan (will be) in Jannah,
Ali (will be) in Jannah, Talhah (will be) in Jannah, Zubair
(will be) in Jannah, Abdur Rahmaan Bin Auf (will be) in
Jannah, Sa`ad Bin Abi Waqqaas (will be) in Jannah, Saeed
Bin Zaid (will be) in Jannah, and Abu Ubaidah Bin

numerous than can be mentioned.

“Anyone who speaks well of the Companions^1 of the

who are all pure and untainted by any impurity, is free^3

“Anyone who speaks well of the Companions^1 of the
Messenger of Allaah ρρρρ ,
1). Because indeed Nabi ρ: “(Fear) Allaah, (Fear)
Allaah, (regarding) my Companions. Do not make them a
target after me (my demise).” Hence, to oppose this after
claiming Islaam, is Nifaaq, the worst form of Nifaaq.

ρρρρ , and his wives^2 and offspring,

in Muslim Shareef that we should remember Allaah
regarding his household. Bukhaari reports from Hadhrat

Abu Bakr τ: “Respect Muhammad ρ with regard to his
household.”

who are all pure and untainted by any impurity, is free^3
from the accusation of hypocrisy.”
3). Indeed, to harbour evil thoughts, swear and malign
the Companions of Nabi ρ and to exceed the limits in
praising his Household and do it in displays of show and
customs is the way of the Rawaafidh (Shiahs). Their
foundation is hypocrisy, because it (Shiasm) was founded
by the renegade and hypocrite, Ibn Sabaa Yahoodi.
Whosoever follows in his footsteps will be drowned in
hypocrisy, and whosoever isolates himself from him and is
pure in his talk regarding the Household of Nabi ρ and
moderate (i.e. remains within the bounds of the Shari'ah),
and has good thoughts and opinions of the Companions of
Nabi ρ will be free and saved from hypocrisy.

“The learned men of the first community and those who
followed in their footsteps — the people of virtue, the
narrators of the Hadith, the jurists and analysts -- they
must only be spoken about in the best way^1 and anyone
who says anything bad about them is not^2 on the right
path. We do not prefer^3 any of the saintly men among the
Ummat over any of the Ambiyaa.”

“The learned men of the first community and those who
followed in their footsteps — the people of virtue, the
narrators of the Hadith, the jurists and analysts -- they
must only be spoken about in the best way^1
1). This is in keeping with the advice of Nabi ρ:
“Honour my Companions, indeed they are the best among
you...” and as Nabi ρ said: “The stars are the custodians
of the sky, if the stars vanish, then follow the sky in what it
‘promises’. I am the custodian of my Companions, when I
pass on, then follow my Companions in what they say, my
Companions are the custodians of the Ummat, when my
Companions pass on, then follow my Ummat in what it
says.” [Muslim]. It is for this reason that the Ahle Sunnah
Wal Jamaa`ah say that ALL the Sahaabah are just and
virtuous.

To love them is Deen and to detest and oppose them is
Nifaaq. This is the path of the believers. After the era of
the Sahaabah came the era of the Tabieen. It is imperative
for the Ummat to honour them after the Sahaabah, and also
to honour the pious and uprighteous Ulama of this Ummat.
This is so, because Nabi ρ has testified in favour of their
excellence, after that of the Sahaabah, when he said: “The
best of eras is my era, then the one after it and then the one
after it.” Also, our Nabi ρ lauded many praises upon the
Ulama, when he said: “Indeed the Ulama are the heirs of
the Ambiyaa.” Also, he ρ made dua for the pious and
reflecting persons of this Ummat, when he said; “Allaah
has blessed that person who has heard my speech, and
then memorised and protected it and then he conveyed it.
Thus many a persons who have been conveyed my Message
are more protective of it than the listener.”

Hence, it is necessary for the Ummat to honour and respect
them, and to speak glowingly about them and remember
them with endearment.

and anyone who says anything bad about them is not^2 on
the right path.
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: " Whoever opposes the
Rasool after the guidance (the truth of Islaam) has
become manifest (clear) to him and follows a path other
than that of the Mu'mineen, We shall allow him to do
that which he is doing and then enter him into
Jahannam. It is the worst of abodes" {Surah Nisaa, verse 115}.
To follow a way other than the way of the believers like
the way of Ibn Sabaa, and other such Munaafiqeen, etc. is
not the way of the path of the true believers.

We do not prefer^3 any of the saintly men among the
Ummat over any of the Ambiyaa.”
3). Because indeed, Nubuwwat is the fountainhead of
Wilaayat. A Wali is nurtured by a Nabi. Hence, he
cannever become a Wali except by him following the way
shown by the Nabi. It is not that a Nabi becomes a Nabi by
following the way of a Wali, or that he is nurtured by a
Wali. In an Ummat there are thousands Auliyaa – do all of
them follow the Nabi or does the Nabi follow the Auliyaa?
The reality is that the one who is followed is better and
more virtuous than his offshoots, that is those who follow
him. Also, Nubuwwat is a gift and an appointment from
Allaah Ta`ala. A Nabi is more knowledgeable since he has
been bestowed with the Divine Message. Wilaayat is
something which has to be earned, and the slave turns
repentantly towards Allaah. Allaah guides whomsoever He
Wills from those who turn to Him. To be chosen by Allaah
is by far more virtuous and honourable than for the slave to
turn to Allaah, hence a Nabi is more virtuous than a Wali.

Also, Nubuwwat has been terminated, there is no more any
Nabi to come after the Seal of Ambiyaa (sallallahu alaihi
wasallam), whereas Wilaayat will remain until the Day of
Qiyaamah. It is possible for thousands of Walis to come
until Qiyaamah.

The chosen and special servants of Allaah are by far better
than the ordinary ones, and not the other way around. Also,
it is imperative for the entire Ummat to follow Nabi ρ, and
none will be successful except if they follow him. A Wali
is not like this, that he has to be followed and that success
lies in following him. Hence, then one upon whom success
is based by following him is better than the one who is
unlike this. Also, a Nabi is sinless, before and after
receiving the Nubuwwat, and a Wali in neither sinless
before Wilaayat nor after. So how can a sinful person ever
be better than a sinless one?

Also, the Sahaabah are revered owing to their being
witnesses to the revelation of the Quraan and the effect and direct influence of Nabi ρ on their hearts and souls, and the Walis do not have this benefit that they can definitely have any effect on their companions, so how can they be better than the Nabi, when they do not have the same effect? Also, Wilaayat is attainable by the common believers according to their piety and status, whereas Nubuwwat is limited to the very special servants of Allaah Taala.

Hence, all believers are Auliyaa of Allaah in accordance to
their piety and status, whereas all of them are not Nabis.
All this is from the Nusoos of the Qur`aan and Sunnah.
Hence the claim that Wilaayat is more virtuous than
Nubuwwat has absolutely no basis and it contradicts the
clear Nusoos.

“Rather we say that any one^1 of the Ambiyaa is better
than all the Auliyaa put together. We believe in what we
know of Karaamat^2 (the marvels of the Auliyaa) and in
authentic stories about them from trustworthy sources.”
“Rather we say that any one^1 of the Ambiyaa is better
than all the Auliyaa put together.
1). As Nabi ρ said: “I am the most honoured of all the
former and latter (of creation)” The Auliyaa are all either
from amongst the former or latter, and our Nabi ρ is more
honoured than all of them, in fact he is the most honoured
from amongst all the Ambiyaa as well. The statement of
the Author ,ا -./ر is that any one Nabi is better than all the
Auliyaa put together. This is a clear truth and fact, and it is
proven from the clear Nusoos.

We believe in what we know of Karaamat^2 (the marvels of
the Auliyaa) and in authentic stories about them from
trustworthy sources.”

2). Al-Karaamat is an extraordinary feat, just like how a
Mujizah (miracle of a Prophet) is an extraordinary act. A Mujizah takes place at the hands of a Nabi whilst a
Karaamat takes place at the hands of a Wali.

It is similar to a Mujizah in that it is an act which emanates from the acts of Allaah Taala, and not from
those of men. It is also not in the choice of the Wali to
exhibit this act whenever he wishes, but Allaah Ta`ala
allows its exhibition at his hands in order to display his
status and honour to the people. This is only done with the

Will of Allaah Ta`ala and within the bounds set by Him.
Thus, an extraordinary act, if it is done within the
framework of the Deen, then it is termed a Karaamat, if
not, then it is called ‘Istidraaj’ or ‘Takhyeel’. It has no
worth or value.

An extraordinary feat does not necessarily denote any
acceptance or rejection from Allaah Taala, because its execution does not even require Imaan. Actual acceptance in the Sight of Allaah Taala is in Deen and remaining firm
thereupon, not extraordinary feats. In summary, Karaamaat
are from the effects of Mujizaat of the Ambiyaa. Just like how the knowledge of an Aalim is sourced from the knowledge of the Ambiyaa. Karaamaat are from the outer displays, which require no proofs. It is in reality an extraordinary feat, which has been established from the Quraan and Sunnah. The Muhadditheen have allocated a
special chapter regarding Karaamaat, wherein the
Karaamaat of the Sahaabah, Taabieen and other pious
predecessors are mentioned. For example, like the
statement of Hadhrat Umar τ: “O Saariya! The mountain!”
And the illuminating of the staff (stick) of Hadhrat Usaid
Bin Huzair and Ubaad Bin Bishr (radhiallahu anhuma) on
a dark night. Also, like the time when there was no Azaan
given in Masjid-e-Nabawi (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) for
three days and Hadhrat Saeed Bin Musaib (a Taabiee) ,ا -./ر
heard a loud sound emanating from the grave of Nabi ρ, by
which he recognised it to be the time for Salaat. Also, at
the time when the conveyance of a freed slave of Nabi ρ
got lost and he found a lion on the road, he said to the lion:
“O Abul Haarith (title given to a lion)! I am the freed slave
of Nabi ρ , show me the way!” The lion started walking
alongside him and guided him to the road. Examples such
as these are plentiful and the authentic Kitaabs are replete

with them. We should believe in them as true and accept
them.

“We believe in the Signs^1 of the Hour (Qiyaamah) such
as the appearance^2 of the Dajjaal.”
“We believe in the Signs^1 of the Hour (Qiyaamah)
1). Regarding this is the Hadith of Hadhrat Huzaifah Ibn
Usaid τ who reports that Nabi ρ said: “It (the Day of
Qiyaamah) will definitely not come until you see ten signs:
Ad-Dughaan (the Smoke), Dajjaal, the Animal (from the
ground), the rising of the sun from the west, the descension
of Isaa Bin Maryam, the emergence of Yajooj and Majooj,
and three eclipses, an eclipse in the east, an eclipse in the
west and one in the land of Arabia, and the last of these is
a fire which will emerge from Yemen and it will usher
people to their mahshar (Plains of Resurrection).”

such as the appearance^2 of the Dajjaal.”
2). The Hadith of Hadhrat Ibn Umar τ who said that
Dajjaal was mentioned to Nabi ρ, and he said: “Allaah is
not unknown to you, indeed Allaah is not one-eyed. Verily
Maseeh Dajjaal is one-eyed in his right eye. His one eye is
like a protruding grape.” [Muslim]. It is reported in one
narration: “There was not any Nabi except that he warmed
his nation about the one-eyed Dajjaal. Know! Indeed he is
one-eyed and your Rabb is not one-eyed. It is written on
his forehead kaaf, faa and raa.” This is explained in
another narration to mean ‘Kaafir’.

“And the descent^1 of Isaa Ibn Maryam υ , from the
heaven and we believe in the emergence^2 of Yajooj and
Majooj, and in the rising^3 of the sun from where it sets
(the west) and in the emergence^4 of the Beast from the
earth. We do not accept^5 as true..”
“And the descent^1 of Isaa Ibn Maryam υ , from the
heaven
1). As Nabi ρ said: “I take an oath in Him in Whose
Hands lies my life! It is soon that Ibn Maryam will descend
amongst you, as a just ruler. He will break the cross, kill
the pig and establish Jizyah. Wealth will be so much in
abundance, that none will be there to accept it. It will be a
time when a Sajdah will be better than the whole world
and whatever it contains.” Dajjaal is the Maseeh of
deviation and Hadhrat Isaa Bin Maryam υ will be the
Maseeh of guidance. He will face and oppose Dajjaal and
kill him Hadhrat Isaa υ will descend from the heaven to
Baitul Maqdis.

and we believe in the emergence^2 of Yajooj and Majooj,
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "...until the time arrives
(just before the Day of Qiyaamah) when Ya’jooj and
Ma’jooj will be released (from behind the wall that Dhul
Qarnayn built) and they will scurry down every hill" {Surah
Ambiyaa ا$#"م '()*+, verse 96}.

and in the rising^3 of the sun from where it sets (the west)
3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "The day when one of your
Rabb’s (major) signs (of Qiyaamah) will appear (when the

sun rises in the West) , the Imaan of a person will not
benefit him (will not be accepted) if he did not have
Imaan previously (before this sign) or if he did not do any
good (act) in his Imaan" {Surah An'aam, verse 158}. The reference
of “one of your Rabb's Signs” is the rising of the sun from
the west, as reported from Hadhrat Abu Hurairah τ from
Nabi ρ in Bukhaari.

and in the emergence^4 of the Beast from the earth.
4). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "When the promise will be
fulfilled to them (mankind) , We shall bring for them a
creature from the earth, which will speak to them (on
Allaah’s behalf saying) “People (especially the Kuffaar)
are not convinced about Our Aayaat (however, they will
now be convinced when they see for themselves, but it is
now too late) ” {Surah Naml, verse 82}. The description of this
beast can be found in the Ahaadith.

We do not accept^5 as true..”
5). Because indeed all of this (fortune-telling etc.) are
from conjecture and imagination. It is a trade amongst
trades, which ‘foretells’ the unseen, and indeed the unseen
is known ONLY to Allaah Taala. The basis of accepting or rejecting it is to be found in the Quraan and Sunnah. If
it conforms to the Quraan or Sunnah, then we will not reject it, and if it contradicts and does not conform to the Quraan and Sunnah, then we will fling it against the wall.

***********************************************

“What soothsayers^1 and fortune-tellers say nor do we
accept the claims of those who affirm anything which
goes against the Qur`aan, the Sunnah and the consensus
of the Muslim Ummat.”
1). Owing to the Hadith of Nabi ρ : “Whoever goes to a
fortune-teller or soothsayer” , it is reported in another
narration “and he asks him and believes as true what he is
told, indeed such a person (one who went to the fortune-
teller) has committed kufr of that which has been revealed

to Muhammad ρ .” In this (fortune-telling and soothsaying)
is dubiousness, obscurity and confusion. If this is the
condition of the one who asks, what can the condition be
of the one who is asked.

The Sahabah ψ reported that sometimes the fortune-tellers
used to say a thing which turned out to be true, so they
reported this to Nabi ρ who commented that this portion is
from the truth, which the jinns overhear (from the
plannings of the angels) and they (jinns) convey this little
bit to their friends (fortune-tellers and soothsayers), after
mixing it with a hundred falsities. Hence it is established
that the person is on baatil who covers the Haqq with
falsehood. From this we ascertain that all such trade and
practice which has to do with conjecture and imagination
are from shaitaan. Whatever emanates from the
imaginations are the fruits of the power of the naffs and not
that of the power of Yaqeen (certainty and belief). For
example are those who look at the stars and foretell
(astrologers), etc. Similar are those who look at signs (stars
and planets) and ‘foretell’ rain. The Qur`aan Majeed has
refuted such acts;

"When favourable conditions prevailed they (failed to
thank Allaah and) said, “This is what we deserve.”

However, when adverse conditions afflicted them, they

would attribute the misfortune to Moosa υ and to those
with him (saying that it is because of their evil presence
that these difficulties exist). Behold! Their misfortune is
with Allaah (in Allaah’s control) , but most of them do not
know it (they think that it is because of other reasons) "
{Surah A'raaf, verse 131}.

Allaah Ta`ala says: "O you who have Imaan! Indeed
liquor (wine, beer and other intoxicants) , gambling, idols
and (distribution by) arrows (to determine fortune) are
filth (vile acts) from the acts of Shaytaan, so abstain from
them so that you may be successful (in both worlds) " {Surah
Maa'idah, verse 90}.

Allaah Ta`ala says from Hadhrat Ibraheem υ: "He glanced
once at the stars (as they normally did) .and then said, “I
feel ill" {Surah Saaffaat, verses 88-89}. Hadhrat Ibraheem υ looked at
the stars as a deception and ruse to his nation, so that they
may believe that he understands the concept of star
(foretelling). They used to believe that the stars move on
their own. He refuted their belief by breaking the idols,
thus proving that they are solid, concrete objects which
have no sense, intellect or power. They were helpless since
they had to be made by the hands of man. Hence, he said to
them: “Do you worship what you yourselves carve
whereas Allaah has created you and what you do?” {Surah
Saaffaat, verses 95-96}. In summary, the basis of this trade is not
on certainty, in fact it is based on conjecture and
assumptions.

The basis of our Deen is Yaqeen. Hence “leave that in
which you have doubt for that in which you have no
doubt.” However regarding amulets (Taweez), there is no
problem with it, as long as it does not constitute shirk.

With regard to acquiring benefit or gaining a jinn, Allaah
Ta`ala has criticised this in Surah Jinn, where He says:
“‘Indeed (adding to our practices of Shirk was that) there
were those from mankind who (when they stopped over at
a scary place during their travels, they would call out to
the leaders of the Jinn at that place and implore them for
protection from other Jinn, in doing so they) used to seek
protection from men (leaders) of the Jinn and (thereby)
increased them (the Jinn) only in rebellion (by making
them feel that since others pleaded assistance from them,
they were too great and powerful to submit to Allaah) "
{Surah Jinn, verse 6}.

For mankind to take service and advantage of the jinn in
fulfilling their needs and in their (jinn) informing them
(men) regarding the things of the unseen, are among the
acts of shirk. It is necessary to stop all this. Such things
despoil the beliefs of man. Such things lead to deviation
and are the acts and ploys of shaitaan, the rejected one. It is
imperative that a rightly guided Muslim avoid all such
things.

***********************************************
********

“We agree that holding together^1 is the true and right
path.”
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Hold fast to the rope of
Allaah (Islaam and particularly the Qur'aan as understood

by the sayings of Rasulullaah ρ and the pious
predecessors) , all of you together, and do not separate"
{Surah Aal Imraan, verse 103}. And as Allaah Ta`ala says:. Do not
be like those (Jews and Christians) who separated (into
denominations because of their desires) and disputed

(about the basics and secondary aspects of their religions)
after clear signs had come to them" {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 105}.
As Nabi ρ said: “(Hold on fast) to the Jamaat.” Allaah
Ta`ala rebukes those who cause dissention and separation

in the Deen, when He says: "Indeed you (O Muhammad ε )
have nothing to do with those who caused divisions
(sects) in their religion (by accepting parts of it and
rejecting parts) and have split into groups" {Surah An'aam, verse
159}.

However, to have a difference of opinion before having
any definite proof or before it becomes apparent, is not
deviation or causing divisions. In fact it is a Mercy (Rah
mat). Like the differences of the Aimmah-e-Mujtahiddeen
in the rulings of Fiqh and the differences between the
Muftis and Ulama in their various opinions which are
based on firm and solid proofs of the Shari'ah, and upon
which they share common principles and basis. All this is a
Rahmat and excluded from rebuke and prohibition.
Anything contrary to this is causing divisions and fitnah,
which is prohibited, as Allaah Ta`ala says: "those who
disagree (create differences) about the Book are
stubbornly opposed" {Surah Baqara, verse 176}.

And that separation is deviation^1 and torment^2. There is
only one^3 Deen of Allaah in the heavens and on earth
and that is the Deen of Islaam^4. Allaah says: ‘Surely
Deen in the Sight of Allaah is Islaam.’ And He also says:
‘I am pleased with Islaam as a Deen for you.’”
And that separation is deviation^1
1). It is due to this deviation that the Ummat falls into
fitnah, rebelling against each other. The Ummat will be
divided into 72 sects, of which all besides one will be in
the Fire. As Allaah Taala says: **_"As for those who have crookedness in their hearts, they pursue_** _(try to interpret)_ **_the ‘Mutashaabihaat’, thereby seeking to cause mischief_** _(causing doubts in the minds of the ignorant)_ **_and seeking their interpretation. None knows their interpretation except Allaah"_** {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 7}. As Allaah Taala says:
"Because of the animosity between them, those to whom
it (the scripture) was given differed concerning it
(concerning the Deen) after clear proofs (of Towheed) had
come to them" {Surah Baqara, verse 213}. And this is
rebelliousness and deviation.

and torment^2.
2). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Say, “He (Allaah) is
Capable of sending to you a punishment from above
(such as a hurricane) or from beneath your feet (such as
an earthquake) , or (He is also Capable of) mixing you into
various groups and then letting you taste each others
brutality (when you fight each other in war) ” {Surah An'aam,
verse 65}.

There is only one^3 Deen of Allaah in the heavens and on
earth and that is
3). Because the Owner of them two and the Ruler of
them and the Creator of them is One. To Him belongs the
Dominion of the heavens and the earth. He has no partner
in His Territory and in His Deen. The Deen of Allaah
Ta`ala is One in the heavens and the earth.

the Deen of Islaam^4. Allaah says: ‘Surely Deen in the
Sight of Allaah is Islaam.’ And He also says: ‘I am
pleased with Islaam as a Deen for you.’”
4). That is, the Deen of obedience and submission. Thus
every creation is to be submissive to Him in this Deen,
both in its (Deen’s) existence and according to its rules
(Shari'ah). Regardless of whether it (the creation) is man,
king, jinn, animal, plant or solid. As Allaah Taala says: **_"...all within the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly surrender to Him and to Him they will all be returned_** _(for reckoning on the Day of Qiyaamah)_ **_?"_** {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 83}. Also, the Deen of Islaam consists generally of servant-hood. It is the only one in the heavens and the earth, as Allaah Taala says:
" (On the Day of Qiyaamah) Everything within the
heavens and the earth shall come to Ar Rahmaan as
slaves (humbly and in submission) " {Surah Maryam, verse 93}.

His Deen is Islaam, which is one in both the heavens and
the earth. The inmates of the heavens are the angels, who
are His slaves. They are subservient and obedient to His
Commands. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "They (the angels) are
but honourable slaves (of Allaah and one’s children can
obviously not be one’s slaves). They (the angels) do not
speak before Him and duly carry out His orders (in
complete submission) " {Surah Ambiyaa ا$#"م '()*+, verses 26-27}.

However, as for the inhabitants of the earth, the most
honoured amongst all of them are the humans. Amongst
them are those who have Imaan, hence they are Muslims
by choice, and there are others who have no Imaan, hence
they are Muslims by existence, without any choice of
theirs. That is they are subservient to the Will and System
of Allaah Ta`ala. Also, all the Nabis and Rasools, from the

time of Hadhrat Aadam and Nooh (alaihimus salaam) until
the time of the Guide of all Ambiyaa, Muhammad ρ, were
all following the Deen of Islaam. This is proven from the
Qur`aan Majeed. The Deen of their Ummats and nations
must also necessarily have been Islaam, since they were
subjected and followed the Ambiyaa of the time.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Whoever seeks a Deen besides
Islaam, it shall never be accepted from him and he will be
among the losers in the Aakhirah" {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 85}.
This statement and ruling is general and applies to all and
sundry. There are no exceptions to it. The Deen for all
Ummats and all nations in all the ages is Islaam. All those
that are in this Ummat and those in the previous Ummats,
lay claim to the fact that the Deen of Allaah is -- Islaam.
Which is the only One in His heavens and earth.

***********************************************
******** “Islaam lies between going to excess^1 .”
1). As Allaah Taala says, refuting excessiveness: **_" O People of the Book! Do not commit excesses in your religion and speak only the truth about Allaah"_** {Surah Nisaa, verse 171}. As Allaah Taala says: "O you who have Imaan!
Do not forbid (declare as unlawful) the pure things that
Allaah has permitted (made lawful) for you (by regarding
something Halaal as Haraam) and do not overstep (do not
exceed the limits of the Shari'ah). Surely Allaah does not
like those who overstep (exceed limits) " {Surah Maa'idah, verse 87}.

When Nabi ρ noticed that some of the Sahaabah were
exceeding the limits in their striving in the Deen, by
(some) not eating meat, not getting married, not sleeping at
nights, not eating during the days, etc. he admonished them
saying: “What is wrong with that nation who say that one

of them is like so and so, whereas I fast and I eat, I sleep
and I stand up in Ibaadat, I eat meat, I marry women.
Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not from me.”

“And falling short^1 , between Tashbeeh^2 (likening
Allaah’s Attributes to anything else), and Ta`teel^3
(denying Allaah’s Attributes).”
“And falling short^1 ,
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: Destruction be for those
performers of salaah (those Muslims who ought to be
performing salaah) who neglect (to perform) their salaah
those who (when they do any good deed like performing
salaah,) are ostentatious (do it to show off before others)
and who (are so miserly that far from spending in charity
and zakaah, they) refuse (to lend others) even minor
articles (of common use that would cause them no loss) "
{Surah Maa'oon, verse 4-7}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: Destruction be to the cheaters
who, when they take measure from mankind (when they
are buying from others) , demand (that their purchase be
given to them) in full. (They ensure that the seller does not
weigh or measure less than they are paying for.)
(However,) If they measure or weigh for people (when
they are the sellers) , they reduce (the weight or
measurement of the commodity so that the buyer gets less
than he pays for) {Surah Mutaffifeen, verse 1-3}.

As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Those who are miserly with what
Allaah has given them from His bounty (especially
miserly in spending for Jihaad) should never think that

this (miserliness) is best for them. Indeed it is worse for
them" {Surah Aal Imraan, verse 180}. Hence, Islaam does not have
excessiveness or falling short. In fact, it is a Deen of
moderation, with no excessiveness on either side.

between Tashbeeh^2 (likening Allaah’s Attributes to
anything else), and
2). As Allaah Taala says: **_"There is nothing like Him_** _(nothing can compare with His Being or His qualities)_ {Surah Shura, verse 11}_._ Allaah Taala loves that He be described with
that which He describes His Honourable Self, without any
comparisons. It is not said that He Hears like we hear or
He Sees like we see.

Ta`teel^3 (denying Allaah’s Attributes).”
3). As Allaah Taala says: **_“And he is All-Hearing, All- Seeing.”_** Allaah Taala loves that we not negate from Him
anything by which He describes Himself with, or from
anything that He was described with by the man who
recognised Him the best from all other men ρ. Hence, His
statement: “There is nothing like Him,” refutes any
comparison to Him, and His statement: “And He is All-
Hearing, All Seeing,” refutes any negation or denial of His
Attributes.

“Between fatalism^1 and refusing Decree^2 as proceeding
from Allaah and between certainty^3 (without being
conscious of Allaah’s Reckoning) and despair^4 (of
Allaah’s Mercy). This^5 is our Deen and it is what we
believe in, both inwardly^6 and outwardly.”
“Between fatalism^1
1). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "It (every soul) shall receive
to its favour that (good acts) which it had earned and to
its harm shall be what (sins) it had carried out" {Surah Baqara,
verse 286}. Hence, the servant is not forced in his actions, in
fact, he earned it by virtue of his own choice.

and refusing Decree^2
2). As Allaah Taala says: **_“And Allaah has created you and whatever you do”_** {Surah Saaffaat, verse 96}_._ Hence, the servant is himself a creation of Allaah Taala and so are his
actions. He is not the creator of himself or his actions.
Qadr preceded the creation. The first Aayat is a refutation
of the Jabariyyah and this one is a refutation against the
Qadariyyah. Islaam is in-between the two (Jabr and Qadr).
Hence, the servant is helpless in his creation but has a
choice in what he earns.

3). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Are they secure from
Allaah’s plan (punishment)? Only those at a loss feel
secure from Allaah’s plan" {Surah A'raaf, verse 99}.

This is a refutation of having only certainty or hope.

4). As Allaah Ta`ala says: "And do not become
despondent of Allaah’s mercy (His mercy will ensure that
you achieve your objective). Indeed only the nation that
commits kufr grows despondent (loses hope) of Allaah’s
mercy” {Surah Yusuf, verse 87}.

This is a refutation of having only despair and fear. Islaam
is between hope and fear, and between certainty and
despair. It is a religion of moderation and its Ummat are
people of moderation. As Allaah Ta`ala says: "Thus (just
as Allaah has guided the Muslims to the straight path) We

have made you (the Ummah of Rasulullaah ρ ) such a
group that is moderate in nature (free from excesses and
shortcomings) so that you may be witnesses (on the Day of
Qiyaamah) over people" {Surah Baqara, verse 143}.

This^5 is our Deen and it is what we believe in,

this Kitaab upto now is the summary of our Deen and our
beliefs, because all of it are from the Commands of the
Qur`aan Majeed and the Sunnah. It has been transmitted to
us from our Salf (pious predecessors) without any flaw or
break in the transmission.

testification of the tongue and actions of the rules of

“And we^1 renounce any connection, before Allaah, with

“And we^1 renounce any connection, before Allaah, with
anyone who goes against what we have said and made
clear.
1). We go towards Allaah Ta`ala in a state of fear and
hope. Having hope whilst fearing, but not in despair nor
with certainty.

We ask Allaah to make us firm in our belief and seal our
lives with it and to protect us from variant ideas^2 ,
scattering opinions and evil schools of view such as those
of the Mushabbihah, the Mutazilah, the Jahmiyyah, the Jabariyyah and the Qadariyyah and others like them who go against the Sunnah and Jamaaah and have allied
themselves with error.”

2). This is an indication to the variant sects and groups
which have all sprung up from whims and spurious
opinions. Those which originated from sick minds as
compared to the clear and authentic narrations from Wahi.
To prefer the ruling and conjectures of the intellect over
what has been narrated and to change the principles of
Shari'ah with the principles of intellect which are contrary
to the principles of Shari'ah and the Deen and then to make
these the proofs for the Shari'ah in place of the actual
Shari'ah – all these are the desire and aims of the baatil and
spurious sects; like the Mushabbihah, Muattalah, Mutazilah, Jahmiyyah, Jabariyyah, Qadariyyah and the
multitudes of other deviant sects that have sprung up.

The Mushabbihah have compared the Creator to the
creation. They have equated the Attributes of Allaah Taala to those of men, in so far as their condition and physical form, etc. this is like the Jews who claim that, Nauthubillaah, Allaah Taala also gets sick like how
humans get sick, and that the angels tend to Him,
Nauthubillaah.

The Mu`tazilas have compared the creation to the Creator.
They have attributed for the creation such attributes which
are specific for the Creator. They have made the creation
the creator of their actions. Like the Christians who have
equated Hadhrat Isaa υ to his Rabb. They have made him a
deity by making an analogy of the present upon the absent.

The Jahmiyyah have negated and denied the Attributes of
Allaah and they believe in Tateel (denying Allaah Taala’s Attributes).

The Jabariyyah have made the servant a concrete senseless
object, with no intellect. They claim that the servant has no
choice in his actions. They are the opposite of the
Qadariyyah. Some of them analyse the creation according
to the Creator and some analyse the Creator according to
the creation. Some of them compare the attributes and
others the actions. Some of them have exceeded the
bounds in negating Qadr (predestination), and others are
the opposite of this. Thus all of them have strayed and
deviated from the Straight Path due to their spurious and
crooked opposition to the clear Nusoos and the narrations
of the Salf. They have differed with the Ahle Sunnah Wal
Jamaaah and have allied and aligned themselves with error and deviation. We ask Allaah Taala to save us from
such evils.

“We renounce^1 any connection with them and in our
opinion they are in error and on the path of destruction.
We ask Allaah to protect us from all falsehood and we
ask His Grace and Favour to do all good, and to shower
His Blessings upon our guide Muhammad ρρρρ and upon
his family and Companions. All Praise belongs to Allaah,
the Rabb of the entire universe.”

1). Following the Sunnah of the Ambiyaa (alaihimus
salaam), in that indeed when they lost hope in the guidance
of the deniers and Kaafireen and saw that they were bent
on deviation, they would renounce themselves from them
by making an announcement in front of them, as Allaah

Ta`ala says to Nabi ρ: "If they turn away (from Imaan) ,
then without doubt Allaah is Aware of those who cause
corruption (and He shall punish them for their sins) " {Surah
Aal Imraan, verse 63}.

And Allaah Ta`ala says from Hadhrat Nooh υ : “If you
turn away (refuse to accept my message) , then (remember
that) I have never asked any reward from you (so you
cannot claim that you have rejected my message because
you were unable to give me what I had asked for). My
reward shall be from Allaah and I have been commanded
to be from those who submit (only to Him) ” {Surah Yunus, verse
72}.

And Allaah Ta`ala says regarding Hadhrat Ibraheem υ:

" (The time is well worth mentioning) When Ibraheem υ
said to his father and to his people, “I absolve myself of
what (gods) you people worship except for the One Who

has created me (Allaah). Undoubtedly, He shall guide
me” {Surah Zukhruf, verse 26-27}.
